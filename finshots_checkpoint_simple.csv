https://finshots.in/archive/the-wakefit-innovations-ipo-explained,2025-12-08,Capital Markets,The Wakefit IPO explained,"8 December 2025 • Capital Markets The Wakefit IPO explained In today’s Finshots, we take a look at the Wakefit IPO, which opens for subscription today and closes on 10th December, 2025. But before we begin, here’s a quick note from our co-founder: “When we started Finshots, our aim was to make finance simple and accessible for everyone. Soon, we realised that understanding finance is just one of the challenges. Making smart decisions, especially around insurance, is a whole different ball game. That’s why we built Ditto, a platform that makes insurance simple. No jargon, no spam, just honest advice from advisors who are only here to help you find the right plan.” So, if you haven’t already, go get your free, personalised insurance advice by clicking here . Now, on to today’s story. The Story When Ankit Garg and Chaitanya Ramalingegowda launched Wakefit back in 2016, they weren’t chasing a furniture empire. They simply imagined a Bengaluru-based brand that could help Indians sleep better, straight from maker to customer without the middlemen. Fast forward nine years, and that modest dream has ballooned into India’s largest D2C (direct-to-consumer) home furnishings player. Wakefit now clocks over ₹1,270 crore in annual revenue and reaches more than 700 districts across the country. That’s not bad for a company that began with mattresses and a belief in good sleep. And now, it is gearing up for an IPO worth ₹1,289 crore . About ₹377 crore will come in through a fresh issue of shares, while the larger chunk will be an offer for sale (OFS). Meaning, the founders and early investors, including Peak XV Partners, will cash out some of their stake. So, as India’s “sleep unicorn” looks for public validation, the question is — should you give Wakefit yours? And more importantly, what’s in it for you? To understand that, you first need to know what the company actually does. At its core, Wakefit runs a straightforward business. It sells mattresses, furniture, and home essentials like towels, mats, rugs, and dinnerware. Nothing overly fancy. But the interesting bit is that it’s the only D2C home furnishings brand in India that has scaled all three categories, with each crossing ₹100 crore in annual revenue. If you break that down, mattresses make up 61% of its sales, furniture accounts for 28%, and the rest — furnishings, contribute 11%. Wakefit sells all this stuff by following an omnichannel approach. About 65% of its revenue comes from its own channels — its website and company-owned, company-operated stores (often called COCO stores). The remaining 35% flows in through external marketplaces like Amazon and Flipkart, plus multi-brand offline outlets. And that mix matters. Unlike pure online players who live and die by marketplace algorithms and commissions, Wakefit spreads its risk and has more control over pricing and customer experience. Then there’s another advantage. Wakefit is a full-stack, vertically integrated player. In simple terms, it designs, manufactures, distributes, and sells everything itself. By cutting out intermediaries, it can experiment faster, tweak products based on feedback, and keep more margin for itself. You could look at the numbers to get a sense of this. Wakefit’s revenue from operations rose from ₹812 crore in FY23 to ₹1,273 crore in FY25. That’s a CAGR of roughly 25% and a pace the company says is about 1.6x higher than the average among its organised peers. Yet beneath this facade of rapid growth sits a more uncomfortable reality — profitability hasn’t quite arrived. Take the latest half-year results for FY26. Up to September 2025 (H1FY26), Wakefit’s net profit margin stood at 4.9%, translating to around ₹35 crore in profit. If you annualise that, you could assume about ₹70 crore in net profit for the year, assuming the business keeps running the same way. But here’s the catch. Once you look at past profits, the latest numbers begin to raise eyebrows. In FY25, the company actually logged a net loss of ₹35 crore (let that sink in). In FY24, a loss of ₹15 crore. And in FY23, a hefty ₹145 crore down the drain. So yeah, it looks like a turnaround, but a confusing one at that. And it begs two questions: What caused this dramatic swing of over ₹100 crore in just six months? And why was FY25 loss-making despite a 29% jump in revenue from operations compared to the previous year? Turns out, Wakefit’s omnichannel strategy is partly coming back to bite it. Let’s explain. The company has been on an expansion spree since 2022, opening retail stores at a rapid pace. For context, it went from just 23 COCO stores in FY23 to 105 by FY25, and it also manages over 1,500 multi-brand outlets. On paper, that looks like a distribution muscle most traditional players would envy. But here’s the thing. When you open stores, you also have to record depreciation on them. And in FY25, that hit Wakefit hard. Its depreciation expense shot up to ₹96 crore, which is nearly 50% higher than the previous year. And that majorly dented its ability to report profits, apart from other factors such as increased employee benefits expenses and marketing spends. Sidebar for context (a nuance worth noting): Wakefit’s COCO stores are all leased, not owned. But under Ind AS 116 (India’s version of Global Accounting Standards), long-term leases must be treated almost like owned assets for accounting purposes. So when Wakefit signs, say, a 5-year lease, it must show this asset on its books called a Right-of-Use (ROU) asset, representing its right to use the store for 5 years, show a lease liability, meaning “we owe rent payments for 5 years”, and reduce or depreciate the value of that asset every year over the lease period. So the higher depreciation you see isn’t because Wakefit bought new equipment. It largely reflects the cost of leasing its stores over time. Now, this matters going forward because half of the fresh money that Wakefit is raising from the IPO will go into opening more COCO stores and lease expenditure for existing ones. Which means one thing: more depreciation. And while depreciation itself isn’t a cash expense, the lease payments it reflects are very real, and they squeeze profits — the very numbers investors scrutinise quarter after quarter. Sure, in the first half of FY26 (H1 FY26), even though Wakefit increased its store count to 125 (from 105 at FY25-end), depreciation stayed nearly flat. That suggests that the stores opened in FY24 have matured enough to start generating returns without fresh capex dragging profitability. But once the IPO-funded stores start operating, that comfortable picture could change again. And then there’s the return on capital employed (ROCE) — a simple way to judge how efficiently a company uses shareholders’ money. In FY25, Wakefit’s ROCE was -0.68%. That’s not a good look. But the more worrying sign lies in its net asset value (NAV) per share. Despite all the growth and buzz, this number has actually slipped from ₹19.48 in FY23 to ₹16.96 in FY25. In plain speak, the value created for shareholders is eroding faster than Wakefit is churning out profits. And finally, the valuation question — is the ask of ₹195 (upper end of the IPO price band) per share fair? Wakefit is seeking a valuation of around ₹6,300 crore post listing. For a company that will likely trade at a P/E (Price-to-earnings ratio) north of 40–50x based on FY26 projections, that’s a pretty high premium. To put things in perspective, its closest listed peer, Sheela Foam trades at 77x P/E. But Sheela Foam is a far bigger business with ₹3,439 crore in revenue versus Wakefit’s ₹1,273 crore, stronger operating profit margins (8.32% EBITDA vs Wakefit’s 7.13%), and a much longer operating history. So despite Wakefit’s narrative of being more efficient, the numbers suggest otherwise. So yeah, Wakefit is undeniably a solid growth story. It has scaled faster than peers, grabbed market share in a category still waiting to mature, and built a distribution network in a few years that legacy players took decades to assemble. But the IPO lands at a moment when Wakefit has to answer a tougher question: can it turn that scale into sustainable profitability and real returns on capital? So if you’re thinking of betting on Wakefit, it might be purely on the hope of continued revenue growth and future margin improvement, not on the strength of today’s financial performance. And that’s okay if you’re a growth investor. It just demands an honest acknowledgement of the risks. But you also have to remember that Wakefit is moving from being a venture-backed growth rocket to a public company with actual accountability for the capital it deploys. Whether it can pull off that transition will decide if this IPO becomes a winning case study or a cautionary tale about the limits of the D2C model in capital-heavy industries. Until then… Note: An earlier version of this story mentioned that Wakefit’s depreciation on its Right of Use assets doesn’t hurt cash flow in the short run. We’ve now corrected this for accuracy.

https://finshots.in/archive/classic-legends-win-back-yezdi-human-washing-machine,2025-12-07,Sunny Side Up,"🍳Classic Legends win back Yezdi, and more...","7 December 2025 • Sunny Side Up 🍳Classic Legends win back Yezdi, and more... Hey folks! As a kid, I hated taking baths. And I’d be lying if I said adulthood changed that. Somewhere in my head, I always imagined a washing machine for humans — hop in, get scrubbed clean, hop out like toast popping out of a toaster. Sounds like a comic strip, I know. But guess what? Someone in Japan has turned a version of that fantasy into reality. Science Co. , an Osaka-based shower tech company, has built a machine that works like an ultra-fancy spa pod, cleaning and drying you in just 15 minutes. You step into a transparent capsule, settle into a built-in recliner, and let warm water rise halfway up around you. Then comes the real magic — ultrafine microbubbles invisible to the eye. These aren’t your ordinary bubbles. They reach deep into pores, clearing out dead skin cells, sebum, and gunk that regular showers never touch. The pod also has sensors strapped to your back, constantly tracking heart rate, blood pressure, and other vitals. Using AI, it adjusts the entire experience in real time — changing water temperature, spray intensity, and even ambience based on your physical and emotional state. While this is happening, calming visuals and soothing music wrap around you like a mindfulness blanket. So yeah, my childhood fantasy has partly come true. And I say ‘partly’ because each unit costs about ¥60 million. That’s roughly $385,000. Definitely not something you can squeeze into your bathroom anytime soon. So for now, only the wealthy or commercial spaces can afford it. But the company claims that if production scales, cheaper home-use versions could show up someday. But that brings us to the bigger question — why did Science Co. build this in the first place? And who really needs a human washing machine? Some media outlets have already labelled it a bizarre contraption , and honestly, it does sound like one until you look at the context. Japan is ageing faster than almost any other country, and a large chunk of its elderly population now needs help with something as basic as bathing. The trouble is, the country doesn’t have enough nurses or caregivers to go around. It’s already short by nearly 3 lakh workers , and that gap could widen to 5.4 lakh by 2040. So Japan is turning to other Asian nations, especially India, to help fill the shortage. In a scenario like this, there has to be something that eases the burden, because traditional bathing isn’t always easy. That’s where this new device begins to make sense. It removes the need for hands-on assistance, lowers the risk of injury, and, thanks to its built-in sensors, keeps an eye on vital signs to flag potential medical issues early. So, what sounds like a luxury gadget suddenly feels more like a timely solution to a growing problem. Of course, right now it still doubles as a luxury wellness product for high-end spas and resorts. But once it becomes affordable, it might change caregiving. And if ageing and lower birth rate trends continue, even India could find itself needing something like this sooner than we think. What do you think? Here’s a soundtrack to put you in the mood 🎵 Aaftaab by The Local Train You can thank our reader, Rishabh Jain, for this great recommendation! Ready to roll? What caught our eye this week 👀 ‘Classic’ Yezdi returns Almost two years ago, Yezdi, the legendary motorcycle brand once sold alongside the cult-classic Jawa, found itself in a courtroom battle over its own name. Ask your grandparents and they’ll probably recall Yezdi with a mix of nostalgia and old-school charisma. Its two-stroke bikes were iconic for many reasons. They struggled to keep up with the Japanese machines of the time, sure, but they earned a place in India’s cultural memory strong enough that when the brand was revived in the last decade, fans welcomed it right back. But somewhere between going defunct in the 1990s and being resurrected in the 2020s, a legal storm had been brewing: one that questioned who actually owned the name Yezdi in the first place. That lawsuit ended with the Karnataka High Court stating that Classic Legends and Real estate developer Boman Irani, the names behind Yezdi’s revival, didn’t own the trademark to the name and as such, they were outright banned from using it! We covered it in our Sunny Side Up edition back then. And oddly enough, this was despite the fact that Ideal Jawa, the original maker of the bikes, was long gone and there hadn’t been any renewal, use, or even a valid listing of the trademark for decades. Now the verdict of this case clearly flipped after almost three years, so what changed between then and now? To understand that, we need to revisit the technicalities of the first case. In the 2022 ruling, the court said that because Ideal Jawa was still under liquidation, its assets, including the trademark, remained in the custody of the Official Liquidator. That was true even though the name had been unused, unregistered and unrenewed for years. Under that interpretation, Classic Legends and Boman Irani had no claim. Naturally, they appealed. Their argument rested on three foundational points. Ideal Jawa had stopped using the trademark long before liquidation began. If the company itself had abandoned the name, how could it suddenly become the liquidator’s property? A trademark only has value if its goodwill survives. After decades of non-use, any goodwill associated with “Yezdi” had disappeared, which meant the old company did not have a meaningful claim to it. Boman Irani had already obtained fresh Yezdi trademark registrations in 2013 and 2014. These were granted long before the modern revival and through proper legal process. These three points formed the basis on which the Division Bench reconsidered the case in 2025. By taking all of this into account, the Karnataka High Court eventually ruled that Ideal Jawa had effectively abandoned the Yezdi trademark. The company stopped production in 1996, went into liquidation in 2001, and the original trademark lapsed in 2007 and 2008. Between that lapse and the registrations obtained by Irani, roughly six years passed, and nobody from Ideal Jawa, the liquidator, or any creditor made a claim. That is what finally restored the Yezdi name to the people actively reviving it, rather than to a company that had long left it behind. So with that, every modern day ‘Yezdi’ owner can breathe easy and smile knowing that their trusty steel steed’s brand name is legally secure.

With that out of the way, let’s take a look back at what we wrote this week. What the Airbus scare tells us about modern infrastructure Airbus had a rough week. One of its A320s suddenly dipped mid-flight, and the investigation didn’t lead to a faulty sensor, loose bolt, or software bug. It led 150 million kilometres away straight to the Sun. A burst of solar radiation had quietly meddled with the jet’s flight-control computers, making the control surfaces respond a split second too slowly. The pilots recovered, but the scare was enough for Airbus and global regulators to scramble, because aircraft are built with layers of redundancy. With the Sun hitting the peak of its 11-year cycle, these flares are now brushing up against the weak points of our modern world, like distorting GPS signals, stressing satellites, overloading power grids, and even disrupting financial systems that run on precise timestamps. So, how do we protect ourselves against this? Check out Monday’s newsletter to find out. DroneAcharya Aerial Innovations has landed itself in SEBI’s bad books DroneAcharya looked like the perfect startup story — celebrity investors, a blockbuster IPO debut, and a shiny narrative about drones powering India’s future. But behind the spotlight was a very different script. Last week, market regulator SEBI unearthed a massive fraud by the management and an advisor linked to the company, revealing bonus shares magically multiplying investor wealth, money routed through shady “software” deals, inflated revenues, and missing disclosures. This meant retail investors were left holding the bag while insiders quietly cashed out with massive returns. But how did a dream IPO turn into a maze of manipulation? Check out our Tuesday newsletter to find out. The Meesho IPO explained While Amazon and Flipkart fought over India’s metros, Meesho quietly built the country’s biggest e-commerce engine by order volume. Meesho has some of the lowest prices, zero-commission sales, and a good discovery-led shopping experience (kind of like shopping on Instagram). However, its IPO filing tells us a more complicated story of rising revenues, but mounting losses, and a business model strained by cash-on-delivery failures. So, how did a company that cracked India’s rising rural economy still struggle with profitability? To find out, check out our Wednesday newsletter . Why India’s Competition law has Apple on edge Look back at any major fines on multi-billion-dollar companies, and there’s a high probability that it came from US or EU courts. Some examples that stick out are the €2.95 billion fine on Google or the $2.5 billion settlement by Amazon over Prime subscriptions. You’ll also notice how India hasn’t been on that list. Our anti-trust and competition laws haven’t been as strong as other courts, but all that changed in 2023-24 with a subtle but costly tweak: global turnover. That one change has Apple sweating over the current anti-trust case it’s fighting against a group of Indian startups called the Alliance of Digital India Foundation and also Tinder-owned Match. On the surface, it looks confusing yet also surprising: Why would a trillion-dollar tech conglomerate worry about a lawsuit involving its commission fees on the App Store? To find out, and also understand how our competition law got here, read our Thursday story here . The economics of Pantone and its colours Ever wondered why Coke’s red feels different from Colgate’s red? Turns out, that’s an American company called Pantone at work. From Kodak’s yellow to Heinz’s red, Pantone quietly dictates how brands look, and how we perceive them. But here’s the catch. Pantone isn’t a colour lab or paint maker. It simply sells colour recipes, yet it has become a global monopoly influencing trends, purchases, and even this year’s pastel-white “Color of the Year”, Cloud Dancer. Which makes you wonder — how did a booklet of swatches turn into billion-dollar global soft power? We answered that, and a lot more about the economics of Pantone and its colours, in Friday’s newsletter. Click here to read it . Finshots Weekly Quiz v2.0 🧠 Hey folks!

https://finshots.in/markets/is-the-rupee-too-weak-or-the-dollar-too-strong,2025-12-05,Markets,Is the rupee too weak or the dollar too strong,"5 December 2025 • Markets Is the rupee too weak or the dollar too strong In today’s Finshots, we explain why India’s currency is under pressure, how global rate cuts and oil prices play into it, and what it means for ordinary Indians. The Story For the last few quarters, India’s economy has been doing quite well. We posted 7.4% GDP growth in January-March 2025, 7.8% in April-June, and 8.2% in July-September this year. This ideally tells us that the economy is doing quite well. But when you look at inflation, the picture becomes even more interesting. October’s inflation data came in at just 0.25% , and, without the jump in global gold prices, it would have actually been negative. Food prices alone saw nearly 5% deflation , and food has around 46% weight in the inflation basket. And here’s the thing. When inflation falls below the RBI’s target range, the central bank is not supposed to sit still. It is believed to nudge inflation up, not down. This is why the Monetary Policy Committee cut the repo rate again on Friday morning, by 25 basis points to 5.25%. This is the fifth rate cut this year, adding up to 125 basis points of easing. Lower rates should, in theory, boost borrowing, revive demand, and push inflation a little closer to the 4% target. However, every time the RBI cuts rates, it also chips away at the attractiveness of the rupee. Lower interest rates make Indian bonds slightly less appealing to foreign investors. And when investors pull money out, they sell rupees and buy dollars. That puts pressure on the currency. Which brings us to the puzzle at the heart of the story. India is the fastest-growing major economy in the world, and yet the rupee has touched an all-time low against the US dollar. So how does a booming economy end up with a weakening currency? That’s where things get interesting. The Indian rupee is currently hovering around ₹90 for $1, a level that was unthinkable just a few years ago. Now, a weaker currency usually brings cheer to exporters because every dollar they earn fetches more rupees back home. But here’s the real problem. India is structurally a net importer. We rely heavily on foreign crude oil, gold, electronics, and industrial machinery. That means every time the rupee weakens, our import bill balloons. And this year, the squeeze is even tighter. India has been cutting back on discounted Russian crude because of the additional tariff. That pushes more of our oil demand back onto the global market, where payments are strictly in USD. If the US rolls back tariffs as India reduces its Russian imports, the rupee could get some temporary relief. But for now, oil is exerting steady downward pressure. Add to that a globally strong dollar. Even as India posts stellar GDP numbers and ultra-low inflation, the USD has surged on the back of high US yields and global uncertainty. When the dollar strengthens broadly, all emerging-market currencies get pulled down with it. And the rupee is caught in that tide. But there’s a deeper twist. When food prices plunge and overall inflation nearly dips negative as we mentioned earlier, it should normally point to economic weakness. But India is doing the opposite. It’s growing at over 8% GDP growth , something no other major economy is doing right now. This unusual combination of high growth plus near-zero inflation creates a strange backdrop for our currency. So, is the Indian rupee weak, or is the US dollar simply too strong? To answer this question, we shall go over a few scenarios and let you decide for yourself. The USD side of the story The dollar has surged for months as US bond yields have remained high and investors sought safety. But the US economy is now showing cracks. Job numbers are soft, and the Market expects the Fed to cut rates sooner than planned. This is exactly what President Trump has been pushing for. And the next Fed chair will almost certainly be someone that he prefers . That means more cuts are likely. Rate cuts usually weaken a currency because investors who want fixed returns move their money out to countries offering higher yields. So, in theory, a Fed rate cut means a weaker USD over time. However, the dollar has a sort of dual personality. The USD is also the world’s safe-haven currency. If the Fed cuts because the US economy is in real trouble, markets panic and investors buy more dollars , not sell them. In such scenarios, every emerging market currency weakens, regardless of how well its own economy is doing. We could say that India is simply caught in that global crosscurrent. The INR side of the story Some rupee pressures are homegrown. A booming Indian economy needs more oil, more electronics, more capital goods. So, we naturally increase imports. However, exports aren’t rising at the same pace. They’re steady at best . In fact, several exporters, especially those dependent on the US, have seen demand soften . This widens the trade deficit, putting steady downward pressure on the Indian rupee even before external factors come into play. Add to this the role of Foreign investors (FIIs). Now, let’s say an FII earns 10% returns in the Indian market. If the rupee weakens by 3%, their effective return in USD drops to just 7%. This currency hit makes foreign investors more cautious, and when the rupee shows persistent weakness, FIIs often pull out money to protect their USD returns. That outflow weakens the rupee even further. In fact, we can see that this is precisely what’s playing out in the stock market for the last 6 months at least: Note: How to interpret this? The 4th column shows the net buy/sell amount of FIIs for the corresponding month. The red numbers show that they have been pulling out continuously for the last 6 months. Does this mean India should rethink everything and go back to the gold standard? Of course not. But it does mean the rupee’s slide shows up in ways that matter to everyday Indians. For starters, we will have costlier oil imports. Every $1 increase in crude oil widens India’s import bill sharply. And a weaker rupee multiplies that impact. Then, we have precious metals. When the rupee falls, gold becomes more expensive even if global prices stay flat. When international prices rise, and the rupee falls, the effect doubles. This is why we Indians buy gold not just as a crisis hedge, but as a currency hedge. Then we have costlier flights, imported electronics, and even app-store purchases priced in USD. All of this will get more expensive, and households will feel this pain long before any inflation data captures it. However, there is a silver lining. In theory, exporters benefit. But India relies on imported inputs for chemicals, electronics, engineering goods, and even pharmaceuticals . When import costs jump, the export advantage erodes. Only a narrow band of exporters (like software service companies) enjoys the clean benefit of a weak rupee. But here’s where the deeper problem lies. Deflation suggests weak pricing power, something usually seen in slowing economies. But India’s strong GDP growth shows rising output, investment, and activity. This disconnect tells us that “deflation” is not a sign of economic slowdown, but something else. Some high-weighted items are seeing prices fall, but services and broader economic activity remain strong (at least on paper). There you have it, folks. The rupee crossing another unfortunate milestone is a reminder of how global politics, India’s energy dependence, and the dollar’s dominance shape the daily life of ordinary Indians. While it is not catastrophic per se, it has consequences and opportunities. India can use this moment to rethink its vulnerabilities, such as oil dependence, import-heavy manufacturing, and limited export diversification, and push for structural reforms that make the currency more resilient over time. The falling rupee is not a verdict on India’s economy. It is simply a nudge, telling us where the cracks still lie. What we do next will determine whether this becomes a short-term discomfort or a long-term turning point.

https://finshots.in/archive/droneacharya-aerial-innovations-sebi-crackdown-sme-ipo-fraud,2025-12-02,Capital Markets,DroneAcharya Aerial Innovations has landed itself in SEBI’s bad books,"2 December 2025 • Capital Markets DroneAcharya Aerial Innovations has landed itself in SEBI’s bad books In today’s Finshots, we tell you how DroneAcharya Aerial Innovations, a company that made a splashy debut on the SME exchange a couple of years ago, ended up misusing IPO money and misleading investors. But before we begin, a quick (and exciting!) sidenote — Last few days left to register for Finshots Idea LabSeason 2!🥳 Students, this is your chance to bag ₹2.25 lakh in cash , pre-placement interviews , cool goodies, and serious bragging rights. Click here to apply . You don’t want to miss this! The Story If you’ve followed the markets long enough, you know that IPO stories usually fall into two buckets. The first is the heart-warming kind — a young company raising money, scaling up, creating value. And then there’s the second kind, where the glossy prospectus is just a shiny cover for a maze of odd transactions, inflated numbers, and accounting acrobatics. DroneAcharya Aerial Innovations, unfortunately, seems to sit squarely in that second bucket. SEBI recently uncovered a long-running scheme to mislead investors, misuse IPO funds, and dress up the company’s financials. And once the dust settled, it barred the promoters and a few others from dealing in the markets till they paid the penalties. But you wouldn’t have guessed any of this if you’d seen DroneAcharya’s debut on the BSE SME exchange back in 2022. The stock listed with a dream 90% gain , the kind of performance that usually signals a promising young business. Investors cheered. Celebrity involvement hyped it. Even SEBI didn’t sense anything off at first. But over the next couple of years, as the company filed patchy disclosures and repeatedly missed mandatory filings, the red flags began to pile up. And when SEBI finally started digging, it realised it had stumbled onto something far bigger than sloppy compliance. It turns out, the playbook had been in motion long before the IPO. The story begins with the company first raising money through something called OCPS or Optionally Convertible Preference Shares. These are preference shares that investors can later convert into equity. Companies like issuing them because they can raise money without immediately giving up voting power, and investors like them because converting at the right time can deliver hefty gains, especially right before an IPO. Now, OCPS themselves aren’t a problem. But issuing them when your revenues are barely ₹3.5 crore and your profits are negative does raise eyebrows — especially if the people buying them include celebrities like Aamir Khan and Ranbir Kapoor. Yet that’s exactly what DroneAcharya managed to pull off. It did something really smart. First, it sold OCPS at a low price to nearly 200 pre-IPO investors. Then it began slowly issuing bonus shares. For instance, it once issued a 6:1 bonus, which means that for every 1 share, you get 6 more and then a 99:1 bonus, where for every 1 share, you get 99 more. So if someone had 1 share, after the two bonuses, that 1 share magically became more than 100 shares. And when the OCPS finally converted into equity right before the IPO, investors didn’t just get the number of shares they had paid for, but also a massive pile of extra shares for free. And because they got so many bonus shares, their effective cost per share dropped drastically, even though the OCPS price sounded high on paper. And when the IPO listed at a much higher price, their profits exploded. Their paper profits surged overnight, and this made it seem like these pre-IPO investors were the “visionaries” who spotted the company early. And just when you think that’s questionable enough, the trail gets stranger. After this, the company quietly transferred over ₹10.6 crore to a private company called Awyam Synergies Private Limited (ASPL) as a payment for software development. The reality? ASPL was fully owned by DroneAcharya’s own promoters, Prateek and Nikita Srivastava. Even when they claimed to have resigned from ASPL, they still held 100% of the shares, which made ASPL a related party under company law. And related-party transactions must be disclosed to investors, auditors, stock exchanges — everyone. DroneAcharya didn’t report any of this in its IPO documents, annual reports or even to the stock exchanges after listing. Some of the money sent to the promoter-owned company later came back, but a lot didn’t. And when promoters quietly move company money into businesses they own, without telling anyone, that’s a serious red flag. Then came the IPO proceeds itself. DroneAcharya raised ₹33.96 crore from the public, promising to spend nearly ₹28 crore on buying drones and accessories, and the rest on general corporate needs. Simple on paper. But when SEBI followed the money, the story it uncovered was anything but simple. Let’s start with the most obvious example. DroneAcharya paid almost ₹6 crore to a vendor named Micro Infratech for GIS and SQL software. But the thing is that this is the kind of software that usually costs a few lakhs, not a few crores. So firstly, nothing that could remotely justify the ₹6 crore bill. And as if that wasn’t enough, when SEBI checked Micro’s bank statements, the money left the account the same day and was sent to random companies that had nothing to do with software. It didn’t look like a software purchase at all, but rather, like a planned way to intentionally move money elsewhere. Another example was of ₹8 crore which went to Data Setu Technologies for more software development. Except the invoices were inflated, the deliverables didn’t exist, and even basic quotations weren’t verifiable. The money left the account but left behind no trace of actual work done. And then there were revenues supposedly earned from companies (customers) like Triconix and IRed. These two alone accounted for ₹12 crore or nearly 35% of DroneAcharya’s operating revenues in FY24. But once SEBI removed that doubtful revenue from the statements, the company would have been staring at a loss of nearly ₹4 crore. Investors who relied on those numbers would have believed the business was growing, when in reality it wasn’t. It didn’t stop there. DroneAcharya kept putting out misleading corporate announcements about small “potential” orders that might never even happen. But investors assumed the company was winning new business and bought the stock because of it. You can see this clearly by just looking at the rise in retail investor participation in DroneAcharya’s stock. For context, at listing in December 2022, over 200 pre-IPO investors held 62% of the company. But just three months later, public shareholding had jumped to 72%. By September 2024, the number of public shareholders crossed 6,400. That means thousands of retail investors were now trading a stock whose financial foundation had been quietly hollowed out. Meanwhile, pre-IPO investors were cashing out. A total of 168 early investors sold over 74 lakh shares in the two years following the IPO, making a combined ₹114.25 crore. That made their total profit ₹89.60 crore, which translates into a stunning 225% return. For perspective, one partner from Instafin Capital, DroneAcharya’s own advisor involved in arranging investors for the OCPS round, made an eye-watering 5,800% return post listing. But here’s the flipside. Retail investors who were drawn in by the company’s fabricated figures and supposed order wins ended up holding shares they bought at sometimes at peak price of ₹100–₹200 (as opposed to the IPO issue price of ₹54 and listing price of ₹102). But once the truth emerged, their losses ranged anywhere between 30% and 60%, making them the last ones standing when the music stopped. That brings us back to the obvious question — if things were this messy from the start, how did big celebrities invest? Well, because celebrity investing rarely works the way people imagine. Celebrities rarely analyse investments themselves. They rely on advisors to spot money-making opportunities. So if someone like Instafin, which worked with DroneAcharya, and probably had a good network, pitched the idea of a future IPO and easy listing gains, celebrities would buy the OCPS for that upside, not for the company’s current financials. Now, that doesn’t make them part of the fraud because they were just looking for a good return. But when regular investors like you and me see big names on the cap table, we assume the due diligence has been done, and we end up chasing the same dream of quick gains too. What we’d end up missing in this excitement though — something that only SEBI could uncover after a thorough investigation, was that barely ₹1.64 crore out of the ₹66.31 crore raised through private placements and the IPO was actually spent on drones and the objects the company had promised to use the IPO proceeds for. That’s just 2.5% of what investors thought they were funding. The rest was either diverted, inflated, or misreported. But despite everything, the penalties imposed ranged from ₹10 lakh to ₹20 lakh per party involved or ₹75 lakhs in total, along with temporary bans from participating in the market, until the fines are paid. Which also means that the people behind this can simply pay their fines and eventually return to business as usual. But retail investors like you and me don’t get a second shot at recovering the money we’ve lost. So yeah, DroneAcharya’s story is a reminder that in the markets, trust is everything — and once it’s broken, no amount of drones, software, or glossy announcements can help lift you off the ground again. Until next time… Correction: An earlier version of this story flipped the bonus share ratio the wrong way around. For instance, 6:1 was incorrectly written as 1:6, which would imply that one bonus share for every six shares held. We regret the oversight and have corrected the error.

Now, on to today’s story. The Story Coca-Cola and Colgate consistently top the charts as the world’s most purchased FMCG products. And you’d probably agree. Chances are you brushed your teeth with Colgate this morning, if not sipped on a Coke. But here’s a thought. If one day Colgate suddenly switched to Coca-Cola’s red, and Coca-Cola borrowed Colgate’s, would you notice? You might shrug and say, “Meh, red is red.” But here’s the fun bit. It isn’t. Colgate likely uses Pantone 1788 C. Coca-Cola, meanwhile, doesn’t have a fixed Pantone shade. Its red is a custom-mixed brand asset, created using CMYK values (that’s cyan, magenta, yellow, and black). But its closest Pantone cousin is 485 C. And yes, when you put the two side by side, the difference is actually huge. Pantone, for the uninitiated, is an American company best known for its colour standardisation system called the Pantone Matching System (PMS). Think of it as a “dictionary of colour”. Designers refer to Pantone codes to ensure the exact shade you want is the shade they print. Now imagine Starbucks printing lakhs of cups around the world. If Starbucks tells a printer in New York and another in Shanghai to use Pantone 3425 C , both know exactly what green to mix and how to mix it. The result? Two cups printed continents apart, but looking identical. This kind of consistency matters a lot in design and packaging. Take Kodak , for example. Before PMS came along, Kodak used multiple printers for its film boxes, which led to wildly varied yellows on store shelves. Some packs were bright and cheerful, while others looked dull. Customers, whether consciously or not, chose to buy the brighter yellow, assuming it meant fresher film. The darker boxes were deemed old or low-quality. It became a real problem for sales . To fix it, Kodak adopted the Pantone system and locked in an official, standardised “Kodak Yellow” or Pantone 1235 C. From then on, no matter where it was printed, Kodak’s yellow stayed Kodak’s yellow. Confusion dropped, and brand identity strengthened. And while we don’t have exact numbers for Kodak’s gains, we do have a striking example from Kraft, the global cheese and ketchup giant . When Kraft standardised Heinz Red using PMS, the results in Turkey were apparent. 97% of customers could visually tell Heinz apart from its competitors. Heinz ketchup usage rose 24%, and non-Heinz branded ketchup refills by street vendors dropped by 73%. That’s the power of Pantone. But here’s the thing. Pantone is essentially just a company that sells PMS colour guides with codes and recipes for mixing shades. That’s their product. Yet somehow, it’s become a global monopoly in colour standardisation. So how does that add up, you ask? To understand that, we need to rewind to 1956 . A young chemistry graduate named Lawrence Herbert joined M&J Levine, a small New Jersey printer that made retail display cards for cosmetics and women’s tights. His job involved hand-mixing delicate colours for product swatches because it was hard to buy the exact shade you needed from ink manufacturers. Retail brands desperately needed consistent colours, especially flesh tones for hosiery and cosmetics. But printers and ink makers were working with vague names like “light beige”, “sand”, or “almond”. Some even relied on odd references like a magazine cut-out, or even a pet dog’s fur, to match a shade. Funny as it sounds, the outcome was chaotic. Minor changes in paper, ink batches or suppliers led to mismatches, reprints, and unhappy clients. Herbert realised this wasn’t just an ink problem, but also a coordination problem. So he devised a solution — ink “recipes” that used specific base colours to reproduce exact shades every single time. If printers used the same bases, they’d get consistent results. Around the same time, M&J Levine was in bad shape. Almost everything except its ink business was losing money. So Herbert bought its technology assets for about $50,000 and spun them off into a new company called Pantone. The name itself is a blend of “pan”, meaning many or across from Greek, and “tone”, meaning hue. And then, just a year later in 1963, Herbert launched the first PMS, which was a fan-style booklet of printed swatches, each with a number and an exact ink formula based on a fixed set of base pigments. To make sure the system took off, he first created a sample page explaining how it worked and sent it to ink makers. Then he started doing something clever. He made sure that everyone in the ecosystem had a reason to adopt Pantone. He went straight to designers and advertising agencies, the people who specify colours. Once designers started writing PMS codes into briefs, printers had little choice but to adopt Pantone. And once enough printers supported it, designers who didn’t use Pantone, risked miscommunication and reprint costs. It was the classic network effect in action. On top of that, Herbert persuaded 20 of the 21 small ink manufacturers to adopt his numbering system. Once most of the supply side standardised around Pantone formulas, it became nearly impossible for a rival system to take root. Because switching would require relearning everything, and no one wanted that. Then came the defining moment. In 1968, Pantone sued Para-Tone, a competitor that tried to produce a near-identical colour guide. Para-Tone argued that colours can’t be copyrighted . After all, no one can own red or blue. Pantone pushed back with a smart counter-argument. Maybe it couldn’t own colours, but it could own the arrangement and presentation of colours that made up its system. Just like dictionaries don’t own words. They own the specific way they’re organised. Pantone won. And that early legal victory cemented that its codes, recipes and system were proprietary, even if the idea of “defining colours” wasn’t. It scared off imitators and slowly turned Pantone into a near monopoly. And over time, Pantone slowly seeped into very trivial, unusual, and sometimes even thoughtful spaces. Calvin Klein reportedly kept a Pantone chip in his kitchen to show his chef the exact colour he wanted his coffee to be. In Japan, hospital workers wear Pantone-coloured scrubs (clothing worn by healthcare workers) in different shades for each day of the week so that patients needing acute long term care can tell what day of the week it is. Heck, even IPL jerseys — CSK yellow, RCB red, are colour-matched using Pantone so they look exactly the same season after season. But to become such a giant, you need repeatable revenue. And just selling colour guides doesn’t quite cut it. Just think about it. Pantone could release a guide today, and clients might buy it once and never need another. Especially if they’re, say, a formal textile company that only works with a limited palette of blacks, whites, browns, and beiges. Pantone saw that coming, and engineered a way around it. Ink and paper naturally oxidise and yellow over time, even if it’s swatched on premium quality paper or fabric. So Pantone explicitly recommends replacing guides every 12–18 months to maintain colour accuracy. In other words, what looks like a one-time reference book quietly becomes a recurring subscription. And these guides don’t come cheap. A full professional plastic-chip set — stacked in a rotating tower display, can cost upwards of $9,000 . Smaller guides range from $300 to $2,000 each. Creative agencies, print shops, textile makers, and brands often buy multiple sets for different offices, teams, or processes, keeping revenue steadily flowing. This single product category is estimated to account for roughly half of Pantone’s business. The rest comes from consulting, licensing, and digital tools. Manufacturers — from paints to plastics to fashion, pay to license Pantone colours. The company even developed the formulation for “ Minion Yellow ”, the exact shade used for the characters in the animated film, Despicable Me , and its franchises. That brings us to the other, and arguably the most fascinating strategy that nudged us to write this story: the Pantone Color of the Year, which the company revealed just yesterday. Every December since 2000, the Pantone Color Institute unveils a colour for the year ahead, sparking media buzz and shaping trends across fashion, design, advertising, and consumer products. 2026’s colour is Cloud Dancer, a shade of serene white (Pantone 11-4201). The annual reveal earns Pantone tonnes of free publicity, reinforcing its image as the global authority on colour. And the chosen shade, whether 2022’s Very Peri , 2023’s Viva Magenta , 2024’s Peach Fuzz , or this year’s Mocha Mousse , quietly influences shopping behaviour and product development across industries. Pantone cites studies suggesting that colour steers up to 85% of purchasing decisions and can boost brand recognition by 87%. The Color of the Year also fuels licensing revenue, as brands roll out limited-edition products in the chosen shade, often in partnership with Pantone. The Moto Razr is a classic example. It releases phones in the newly announced colour every year, and 2026 is likely to be no different. So if you suddenly see this specific pastel shade of white everywhere, in merchandise, marketing, cosmetics, or clothing, remember, it’s no coincidence. It’s Pantone’s subtle marketing machine at work, cementing its soft power around the world.

https://finshots.in/archive/why-indias-competition-law-has-apple-on-edge,2025-12-04,Policy,Why India’s Competition law has Apple on edge,"4 December 2025 • Policy Why India’s Competition law has Apple on edge In today’s Finshots, we break down why Apple is suddenly sweating over the Competition Commission of India’s (CCI’s) new penalty rules, and why it has taken the regulator to court. But here’s a quick sidenote before we begin. Insurance actually matters only in one moment — when your family needs to make a claim. Most people never hear real claim stories until it’s too late. But choosing the right plan is just as important. Many people buy policies that don’t fit their needs, miss key features, or overlook small details that cause trouble later. So this weekend, we’re hosting a free 2-day Insurance Masterclass built around real cases we’ve handled and simple rules for shortlisting the right plan. 📅 Saturday, 6 Dec ⏰ at 10 AM: Life Insurance How to protect your family, choose the right cover amount, and understand what truly matters during a life claim. 📅 Sunday, 7 Dec ⏰ at 10 AM: Health Insurance How hospitals process claims, common deductions, the mistakes buyers usually make, and how to choose a policy that won’t disappoint you when you need it most. 👉🏽 Click here to register while seats last . Now, on to today’s story. The Story If you noted the biggest antitrust penalties ever imposed worldwide, the US and European Union (EU) would dominate the list. Some of the biggest penalties imposed have been by their anti-trust courts, like the EU’s €2.95 billion fine on Google for abusive practices in online advertising technology, or the landmark $2.5 billion settlement by Amazon over Prime subscriptions. Historically, India hasn’t appeared on that list — at least not publicly. For a long time, anti-trust or competition laws in the US and EU have been iron-clad, and that keeps companies in check. That’s why when firms get fined there, the penalties climb into the billions. Follow the law and you operate freely. Breach it and you bleed money in settlements and penalties. But that opened up one grey area: operating in countries with weaker competition laws while evading scrutiny back home. For a long time, companies enjoyed this grey area, breaking rules in smaller markets without worrying that it would dent their bottom line. Until now. Apple became the first multinational company to publicly challenge India’s revamped Competition law penalty. One of the biggest names in tech locked horns with the Competition Commission of India, and it sounds strange until you hear the details. It started back in late 2021 , when a complaint from a group of Indian startups called the Alliance of Digital India Foundation and later Tinder-owned Match went to the CCI over Apple’s App store rules. On the surface, in-app payments seem simple. You buy a subscription or a one-time upgrade, and the developer gets paid. But Apple took a flat 30% commission on every transaction and required developers to use its own billing system. That made everything expensive for both developers and end users. According to the group, it hurt competition and became a solid entry barrier. Some big names have fought Apple over this in the past as well, including Fortnite . Then came the turning point in 2024 , when the CCI put its new law into operation: Determination of turnover or income. Under this, penalties could be calculated based on the global turnover of the company . That’s great news for Indian consumers because it means tech giants would play by the rules and penalties wouldn’t just be the ‘cost of doing business’. The updated Competition Act was published in April 2023 but took effect the following year. Of course, Apple is fighting back because the amended law exposes the company to far higher penalties than before, and it has taken the matter to the Delhi High Court. The CCI, for its part, has accused Apple of trying to stall the antitrust proceedings. But what has Apple truly on edge isn’t a single dispute over a 30% commission. Under the new framework, the potential penalty could theoretically be up to 10% of its global revenue or roughly $38 billion across the last three fiscal years. Suddenly, even a case arising from India — a relatively small market for Apple (at least when compared to China and the US), carries the threat of a multibillion-dollar fine. Regulators like CCI exist to keep markets fair and stop any one company from becoming a monopoly with predatory practices. Even then, when companies do play unfairly, penalties curb bad behaviour and put a number to the price of their actions. Each case sends a message: Play fair or pay fines. Here’s the catch though. India wasn’t imposing fines as heavily as regulators across the globe. That’s why foreign companies are now worried. Before, penalties were tied only to their smaller India operations and revenue. How does that work? Say you’re driving through traffic and get pulled over by the traffic police for jumping a signal or not wearing your seatbelt. Whether the car you’re sitting in is a small Maruti or Hyundai or an imported Rolls Royce, the fine is the same and it’s only for the penalty you committed then and there. A billionaire wouldn’t feel the same pinch as a college student or regular office-goer. Translation: the punishment didn’t match the violator’s wallet. This meant that big companies could break the rules here in India and be held accountable for a small, manageable cost. Now imagine the rules changed and your fine is 10% of your annual income. Now, the billionaire has as much, if not more, to lose than the college student. This is exactly what the Competition Amendment Act’s penalty would now work like. The penalty isn’t proportional to its local revenue, but to its global turnover and scale of the company that’s breaking the rules. From this shift, India has become a jurisdiction where penalties aren’t as simple as tax write-offs and can actually start impacting quarterly filings and global annual reports. Naturally, companies are afraid of this for a number of reasons. It increases compliance costs and paperwork, their risk and, most importantly, reduces their ability to absorb any impact as just another expense. But wait, how did we get here and where did it all start? To understand why India rewrote its penalty rules, we need to go back to a courtroom in 2017. It was a case that most people hadn’t heard of, related to pesticide tablets, and a few companies that thought they were being clever. It was called the Excel Crop Care case, and it set the stage for everything happening with Apple in India today. Back in 2011, the Food Corporation of India (FCI) accused four companies — Excel Crop Care, United Phosphorous Ltd (UPL), Sandhya Organics Chemicals and Agrosynth Chemicals of bid-rigging and cartelisation. These companies were manufacturing something called aluminium phosphide tablets (APT) and supplying it to the FCI. Going by their names, you’d think they were four different companies but in reality, they moved as a pack, quoting similar prices, backing out of tenders altogether. The CCI investigated this, and slapped a penalty on all of them. That’s where things got interesting. The CCI didn’t just look at what these companies earned from their APT business. Instead, it went after a percentage of their entire turnover. Take Excel Crop Care, for instance. Its average three-year turnover was about ₹710 crore, so the penalty came to ₹63 crore. But here’s the twist. The turnover from its APT business was only around ₹32 crore. UPL faced a similar fate. Its overall turnover stood at roughly ₹2,804 crore, but its APT revenue was barely ₹77 crore. Yet the CCI slapped a penalty of ₹252.44 crore. The punishment had ballooned far beyond the scale of the wrongdoing. This form of penalty is similar to penalising a supermarket with the sales of the whole chain, because they overcharged on selling one item. The case made it to the Supreme Court which ruled that fines and penalties cannot be shocking or disproportionate to the actual revenues. Going by this logic, Excel Crop Care’s penalty dropped from ₹63 crore to just ₹2.9 crore, and UPL’s from ₹252 crore to ₹6.9 crore. That judgment exposed the loophole. For conglomerates and multinationals with multiple product lines, penalties tied only to the relevant turnover could become too small to matter. Even when violations were proven, the financial hit could be insignificant. That case set the ball rolling for the reform that finally arrived in 2023. Ironically, when the Supreme Court restored the idea of relevant turnover, India actually moved away from global practice. But the European Union — one of the world’s strictest regulators — uses turnover-based antitrust fines (up to 10% of global turnover) to force behavioural change . So while this might feel new in India, the EU and US have followed such models for years. But the goal was never simply to impose heavier penalties or make businesses feel the sting. It was to ensure companies played fair — both with consumers and within the industry. India is now a major market with millions of customers. The old rules weren’t built for an economy of this size, which meant reform was less a question of “if” and more of “when”. Whether Apple wins its legal battle remains to be seen. But until then… India’s message is simple: If you want to build here, you have to play fair.

https://finshots.in/archive/the-meesho-ipo-explained,2025-12-03,Capital Markets,The Meesho IPO explained,"3 December 2025 • Capital Markets The Meesho IPO explained In today’s Finshots, we break down the Meesho IPO, the company that quietly became India’s largest e-commerce platform by order volume, long before most people realised what was happening — as it opens for subscription today and runs till 10 December. But here’s a quick sidenote before we begin. Insurance actually matters only in one moment — when your family needs to make a claim. Most people never hear real claim stories until it’s too late. But choosing the right plan is just as important. Many people buy policies that don’t fit their needs, miss key features, or overlook small details that cause trouble later.

Now, on to today’s story. The Story If you live in a big city like Bengaluru, Mumbai, or Chennai, e-commerce feels like a world designed around you. You get same-day deliveries, branded packaging, algorithmic recommendations, and a level of convenience that makes waiting even 24 hours feel unreasonable. But step outside the metros and the entire picture changes. In Tier-2 and Tier-3 India, incomes are lower, and speed matters far less. People are willing to wait a week if it helps save ₹50 on a T-shirt, and they aren’t as eager to chase brands as they are to get a bargain. Behind this low-price aesthetic sits Meesho, one of the biggest consumer internet machines India has ever seen. And now, that company wants to go public. While Amazon and Flipkart poured a lot of money into capturing premium customers in big cities, Meesho quietly built a giant by doing the exact opposite. It embraced India’s price-sensitive heartland, powered its platform with micro-creators, and irresistibly low prices, and in the process, ended up shipping nearly 29–31% of all e-commerce orders in the country. To understand why this matters, we need to first understand what Meesho actually does. At its core, Meesho is a marketplace that connects millions of small sellers with buyers across the country. But unlike traditional platforms, Meesho doesn’t charge most sellers a commission. It built a zero-commission model that dramatically lowered the barrier to entry for manufacturers and home-grown businesses. When you tell a small seller that they can reach millions of customers without paying upfront fees, they show up in droves. That influx of sellers, in turn, creates the endless variety of low-priced goods that attracts Meesho’s user base. And the magic of the business lies in how people actually shop on the platform. Unlike Amazon, where most people search for specific products, Meesho is driven by discovery. Users browse through feeds, creator videos, trending items, and curated collections, stumbling upon things they didn’t intend to buy. The purchase journey is closer to scrolling through Instagram than searching through a catalogue. This discovery engine is so central to Meesho that a part of the IPO proceeds will be used to strengthen its creator ecosystem, feed algorithms, and content-driven shopping experience (marketing & brand initiatives). But Meesho isn’t just the marketplace you see on the app. Buried deep inside the IPO prospectus is another segment the company believes could become important in the future — New Initiatives . This includes low-cost logistics services, a grocery fulfilment network, and Meesho Payments, which aims to provide digital financial services to sellers. Today, these initiatives contribute almost nothing to revenue in absolute terms. But their growth rate tells a different story. Segment revenue went from ₹79.2 lakh in FY23 to ₹1.4 crore in FY24 and then to ₹4 crore in FY25. For a company operating at Meesho’s scale, even small improvements in logistics costs or the successful rollout of daily-use categories like grocery could have an outsized impact in the future. Similarly, a payments and credit ecosystem for millions of small, unorganised sellers could create higher-margin revenue streams that the core marketplace cannot generate on its own. Still, the present reality is anchored in the marketplace business. And Meesho’s revenue model is a complex bundle of service fees sellers pay to operate on the platform. Forward and return shipping fees make up a sizable portion of income. Meesho Mall sellers pay mall fees that combine commissions with additional shipping-related charges. Advertising has become a meaningful revenue line too, especially as creators increasingly drive product discovery and sellers pay to promote visibility. The platform also earns from value-added services such as assurance programs that protect sellers from unpredictable return costs, pilot-phase fees routed through logistics partners, and even a share of interest income when NBFC partners lend money to sellers. Because the RHP ( IPO document ) does not break these pieces out separately, all of this sits inside the broad Marketplace revenue figure. But you can see the topline story: revenue from operations climbed from ₹5,734 crore in FY23 to ₹7,615 crore in FY24, and then to ₹9,389 crore in FY25. That is good growth in absolute terms. The bottom line, however, tells a different story. The company recorded a loss of ₹1,564 crore in FY23, followed by a smaller loss of ₹324 crore in FY24, only to swing dramatically to a staggering loss of ₹3,945 crore in FY25. The financials also raise questions about earnings quality. Other income, at ₹511 crore in FY25, plays a non-trivial role in supporting total income. And “other expenses”, which is a broad category that includes fulfilment, logistics, advertising, and seller enablement costs, is massive at ₹9,120 crore. But perhaps the most significant structural challenge in Meesho’s business is its relationship with cash-on-delivery (COD). COD is what powered the company’s rise in price-sensitive markets, but it also injects a lot of volatility into unit economics. COD orders are successful only 77% of the time, whereas prepaid orders succeed 97% of the time. Every unsuccessful COD order carries two logistics costs: the forward delivery and the return, with no revenue to offset them. On a platform built around low average order values, the cost of these failed deliveries can pile up quickly. Add the fact that delivery times are still close to a week, similar to Amazon or Flipkart in the 2010s, and the path to consistently profitable unit economics becomes tricky. Competition is another pressure point. Deep-pocketed rivals like Amazon and Flipkart can subsidise sellers, waive fees, and undercut prices for longer than Meesho can. The company itself called out the risk of competitors using aggressive pricing strategies that compress Meesho’s market share or force it to increase fulfillment and marketing spends. This pressure becomes even sharper because Meesho relies heavily on advertising and seller service fees for monetisation. If ad yields fall or sellers reduce promotional spending, revenue growth could slow, and margins could compress even further. All of this brings us to the heart of the matter. Meesho is a rare business that has built extraordinary scale in markets that were once considered unprofitable or too fragmented. Its audience, seller relationships, content-led demand funnel, and logistics pipes are valuable assets. But scale is not the same as profitability. The filing presents a company that is growing rapidly but also burning cash aggressively and carrying significant operational challenges. The company wants ₹5,421 crore worth of IPO funds, ₹4,250 crore of which is a fresh issue and will be used to invest in technology, expand logistics, hire AI talent, and deepen its marketplace capabilities. These are sensible areas to strengthen. The rest, a smaller portion of the IPO is an offer for sale. The valuation seems reasonable if you look at the upper price band of ₹111 relative to its book value per share, which works out to about 9 times (P/B) . Meesho’s peers, on the other hand, trade at a P/B ratio of about 17 times. And since Meesho has made losses all these years, its Earnings Per Share (EPS) is negative, which means you can’t compare it to its peers using the P/E ratio. Yet the bigger question remains whether Meesho can fundamentally improve its unit economics in a model where returns, long delivery cycles, and COD create persistent cost pressure. For long-term investors, the primary question isn’t whether Meesho can keep growing, but if it will ever translate this growth into healthy margins and sustainable cash flows without repeated injections of capital.

Are you making travel and vacation plans already? Well, Booking.com has released its Travel Predictions for 2023 and they believe that 73% of people are more optimistic about their travel plans this year compared to 2022. And at the top of the list of the kind of holidays that people want to experience are the ‘nostalgic’ kinds. People want to ditch their constantly dinging smartphones and go back to simpler times. Do more family reunions and visit the theme parks too. There’s even a bunch of other folks who want to step out of their comfort zones and do some wild stuff — like going on a hunt for UFOs! What’s on your bucket list for this year? Here’s a soundtrack to get you in the mood 🎵 That Morning by Ronnie & Barty Ready to get the Sunday started? What caught our eye this week 👀 Who owns the Yezdi? Have you heard of the catchphrase ‘Not for the saint hearted’? Well, it belongs to the motorcycle brand Yezdi. The name might ring the bell for bike enthusiasts. But for the ones who’ve never heard of it, the Yezdi was a vintage Indian motorcycle sold by Ideal Jawa during the retro days. It was all the rage back in the 1960s and 1970s and competed alongside sturdy bikes like the Royal Enfield and Rajdoot. Back then, the bike was hugely popular as it was one of the most affordable performance bikes of its time. But with the entry of the Hondas and Yamahas, it slipped into decline. This, backed by supply chain and labour troubles, ended its legacy. It wound up operations in 1991. And went into liquidation 5 years later. Over a quarter century later, Classic Legends (Private Limited), revived the Yezdi. Real estate developer Boman Irani got together with Mahindra & Mahindra to rekindle the nostalgia of the Yezdi bike. But the Yezdi soon vroomed into some legal trouble. People complained that Classic Legends didn’t own the ‘Yezdi’ trademark. And the Karnataka High Court agreed! They’ve now barred Classic Legends from using the ‘Yezdi’ trademark. Now let’s rewind a bit to the 1960s. That was when Irani’s father Rustom and his business partner Farrokh decided to bring the Czech brand Jawa to the Indian shores. They set up a factory in Mysore and began manufacturing these rugged bikes. A decade later, they decided to Indianise the brand and named it Yezdi. They applied for a trademark too. Now here’s the thing. Around 2013, Boman Irani had the fledgling idea to bring the Yezdi brand back into India. So he went and called dibs on the Yezdi trademark at Mumbai, Delhi, and Ahmedabad’s trademark offices. He figured that the trademark had lapsed anyway when Ideal Jawa went bankrupt in the 90s. But not everyone was happy. The Ideal Jawa Employees’ Association questioned how a trademark of a company that was still undergoing liquidation could be sold to a third party. Yezdi soon became the centre of a trademark storm. And that’s when the Karnataka HC stepped in and temporarily pressed the pause button on it by ruling in favour of the defunct Ideal Jawa. Why? Apparently, the Yezdi trademark wasn’t owned by Rustom Irani. It was registered by Ideal Jawa and it was basically company property. So it seems like not everything that wealthy fathers own passes on to their kin. PS: Remember our story on trademarks ? Read it if you haven’t already. Infographic 📊 Quirkonomics 💸 Using behavioural economics to honour your new year’s resolutions It’s that time of the year. Again. When we all jot down our aspirational goals and strive to be better versions of ourselves. We’re talking about new year’s resolutions. More often than not, we tend to stray away from the new goals we set for ourselves. Like reading more, being punctual, losing weight or even ditching those late-night shows to get more bedtime! And it seems there’s a reason why we falter. A research paper published in the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences says that it’s got a lot to do with mental accounting periods. Meaning, we tend to have time frames in our heads marked by temporal landmarks, like a new day, week, month or year or even a birthday. As we hit these landmarks, we’re more motivated towards kickstarting a brand new period of change. Irrespective of how the previous day, week, month or year went by. So say, for instance, you’ve been a huge couch potato and you suddenly resolve to be more active as the new year starts. Working out or more physical activity may not have been your thing, but you feel energised out of the blue at the beginning of a fresh year. It’s called the ‘Fresh Start Effect’. The paper actually studied people in the US and how they worked around their resolutions for new mental accounting periods. And guess what they found? People are likely to commit to their goals (like dieting or hitting the gym) by 63% at the beginning of a new week, by 24% at the beginning of a new month and wait for it… by 145% at the beginning of a new year! But as time passes, we tend to deviate from our goals and lose focus. Creating a vicious cycle of the fresh start effect. But what if we could use behavioural economics to stay put? Meaning, if you want to get a certain outcome, you have to nudge yourself towards stuff that will let you get it. Rather than cosying up to behaviour that will keep you away from your goals. Like, do things that incentivise your success. Maybe write your goals and send them over to your family or friends. Make yourself accountable to them. So, now you know that there’s someone monitoring your progress. And there’s no turning back. To make it even better, set some kind of compensation that you’ll have to pay if you don’t accomplish your goals consistently. Say, if you miss a day of workout, you pay your roommate ₹500. A lower payoff may not pinch you much so you can’t be lenient here. What do you think? Can you turn 2023 in your favour with this cool behavioural economics trick? Money tips 💰 Daydreams No one likes to be left alone with just their thoughts. It’s tough. Even if you’re asked to daydream about pleasant thoughts, it’s tough. In one study , people said it’s as enjoyable as ‘brushing your teeth’. And we know that brushing our teeth is a chore, right? It’s not fun. But daydreaming is definitely better than scrolling mindlessly on your phone. And maybe it can help kickstart your financial goal planning? So take some time out today and dream. Visualize how you want your life to look in 2023. Maybe you want to learn a musical instrument. Or a new language. Maybe you want to enjoy a vacation or two. Then expand the daydream a bit. Think a little farther into the future. Picture your ideal life. Is it by the beach or in the mountains? Is it baking or cooking at home as you pursue your passion? Is it driving a spanking new Mercedes to your swanky office building? Now think about the kind of people who you’d want to spend time with. Is it rich techbros who drop the word ‘hustle’ in every sentence? Or are you at home with your closest friend and family? The only caveat. Your dream should be yours. And not what LinkedIn posts expect you to have. Once you’ve got these dreams sorted, write them down on a sticky note. Your daydreams are now as real as it gets. The next step is to figure out how much you need to amass to achieve each of those goals. And start investing. Readers Recommend 🗒️ The Courage to be Disliked by Ichiro Kishimi & Fumitake Koga This book is recommended by our reader Mayank Sekhani who says that “it talks about relationships that we share with people and how we fool ourselves by telling ‘If only I could’ve tried this I would have done this’.” The authors use the psychological theories of Alfred Adler to teach us the lessons we need to liberate our real selves and find lasting happiness. Sounds exactly like what we all need in 2023, yes? *** So that was our first Sunny Side Up edition in the new year folks! We hope that 2023 is kinder to us than last year.

Hey folks! Have you ever noticed how term insurance forms suddenly get very nosy the moment you mention smoking? One harmless tick in the “Yes, I smoke” box and your premium shoots up like Nvidia before earnings day. But when the insurer asks, “Do you drink?” and you say, “Yes, I drink occasionally”, the insurer basically shrugs. No major premium shock. No interrogation. At the most, a slight premium increase. So what’s going on here? Why does one cigarette increase your premiums faster than a glass of whisky? Well… because for insurance underwriters, smoking is the one vice that behaves exactly the way the textbooks say it should. Several research papers ( this , this , this , and many more) tell them the same story: smokers face a much higher risk of cancer, stroke, heart disease, and pretty much every health condition doctors warn you about. It’s predictable, consistent, and statistically proven. And insurance, as an industry, is based on probability — What is the chance that this person makes a claim in a given year? Since they know that there’s a very good chance a smoker will make a claim, it helps them price your risk with the confidence of a CBSE topper solving a 10-mark question. But you’re probably thinking that consuming alcohol also has its risks. And you’re right. If you drink responsibly, the harm isn’t as immediate or severe as smoking, especially for the heart . Harmful or chronic drinking is where the real trouble starts. So insurers don’t slap a blanket premium hike on someone who enjoys a peg or two. So they avoid blanket punishments. Your premium doesn’t rise just because you enjoy a drink. It rises only if your medical reports say your drinking has already started affecting your health. Smoking, meanwhile, doesn’t need this detective work. If you smoke, they already know your risk profile. The data is so consistent, the premium hike practically calculates itself. So the next time your term insurance quote jumps after you admit you’re a smoker but stays calm when you admit you drink, remember: Smoking is a guaranteed risk. Drinking is an uncertain one. And if you’re unsure how your lifestyle choices might affect your premiums, you don’t have to guess. Just speak to one of our advisors at Ditto . They’ll help you understand what insurers look for, how to pick the right cover, and how to avoid paying more than you need to. It’s free, unbiased, and spam-free. Here’s a soundtrack to put you in the mood 🎵 Mausam by Anirudh Varma Collective You can thank our reader, Swasti Jain, for this beautiful rec! Ready to roll? What caught our eye this week 👀 The Forgotten Air India Plane We’ve all forgotten something or the other: House keys, watering the plants, paying off that credit card or maybe even taking our wallet when we go out. But here’s the thing about forgetting. Since it’s essential to your life, you eventually remember it, usually at the exact moment when you need it the most. And if it can happen to any of us, it can happen to big companies too right? But what if it wasn’t something as small or even forgettable? What if… it was a whole Boeing 737? That’s exactly what happened when officials at Kolkata’s Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport, where it was found, asked Air India to remove the airplane from its premises. For about 13 years, the airplane just sat collecting dust parked on a desolate runway. To make it more interesting, the CEO, Campbell Wilson, wrote to the staff stating that the company wasn’t even aware that it existed in the first place! And this wasn’t just any aircraft. A look at its history shows that it had lived several lives across its 43 year lifespan. Initially it was delivered in September 1982 to Indian Airlines. For about 16 years it operated under them before it moved to Alliance Air under a lease in February, 1998. Finally it was returned to Indian Airlines as a cargo plane in 2007, where it would be used by India Post. After Indian Airlines and Air India merged that same year, it became part of the Air India fleet. 5 years later, in 2012, the plane was grounded at Kolkata airport where it stayed and was quietly forgotten, similar to putting something in the ‘basement’. In the 13 years between being abandoned and rediscovered, the Tata Group bought Air India back, old departments were dissolved, new systems were installed, and in that transition the plane simply vanished from the airline’s asset records. But here’s the twist. The airport forgot about it too. It was sitting on a remote parking bay — far from busy terminals and far from anyone’s checklist. Staff changed, space was reallocated, and the plane blended into the background like a piece of oversized equipment nobody questioned anymore. Then during a routine survey of old equipment and obstacles on the airfield, someone finally pointed at the hulking aircraft and said, essentially, “Whose plane is this?” Because Kolkata airport was looking to do expansion work, it needed the space and that’s when they stumbled upon it. When the notice went out, Air India looked into its fleet records… and found nothing and the CEO’s internal note confirmed it: the airline had genuinely forgotten it owned a 43-year-old Boeing. The plane wasn’t a skeleton — it still had an engine. A working (or at least intact) engine. After being rediscovered, Air India took the long lost plane off Kolkata airport’s hands and took it to Bengaluru, where it will now be used to train future aircraft engineers. And for its final journey, the aircraft didn’t take to the skies — it took to the roads, traveling roughly 1,900 km on a massive multi-axle trailer. Not a bad way to go, all things considered. So this Sunday if you’re feeling guilty over that one forgotten task from the week before, don’t be. At least you didn’t forget a Boeing airplane 🙂 Infographic 📊 Readers Recommend 🗒️ This week, our reader, Simran Verma, recommends reading All That We See or Seem by Ken Liu.

https://finshots.in/archive/what-the-airbus-scare-tells-us-about-modern-infrastructure,2025-12-01,A bit of Everything,What the Airbus scare tells us about modern infrastructure,"1 December 2025 • A bit of Everything What the Airbus scare tells us about modern infrastructure In today’s Finshots, we look at how a burst of energy from 150 million kilometres away managed to unsettle a $100 million aircraft and what it means for the rest of our hyper-connected world. But before we begin, a quick (and exciting!) sidenote — Last few days left to register for Finshots Idea LabSeason 2!🥳 Students, this is your chance to bag ₹2.25 lakh in cash , pre-placement interviews , cool goodies, and serious bragging rights. Click here to apply . You don’t want to miss this! The Story Earlier this week, Airbus issued an urgent advisory to ground most of its fleet worldwide after an A320 briefly lost altitude mid-flight. Engineers quickly traced the anomaly to something strange and quite literally out of this world. A burst of solar radiation had interfered with the aircraft’s flight-control computers, causing the elevators and ailerons to respond sluggishly. Although the pilots regained control and landed safely, the incident triggered an immediate technical investigation by Airbus and aviation authorities across Europe, the US, and India. And for good reason. Modern jets are built with layers of redundancy, backup systems, and hundreds of hours of testing. So when something 150 million kilometers away can nudge an aircraft into an unexpected dip, it gets everyone’s attention. But why did radiation suddenly affect the aircraft in the first place, you ask? After all, the Sun has been flinging radiation toward Earth for millions of years, and our magnetic field usually absorbs or deflects these cosmic tantrums. Turns out, the reason this is suddenly back in the spotlight is because of the solar cycle we’re in. You see, the sun has a cycle in which solar activity peaks and troughs. This cycle lasts for approximately 11 years. And in November, we had the strongest solar flare of 2025 . Source: ESA, NOAA If a flare is strong enough to breach parts of the Earth’s magnetic shield, it can disrupt pretty much everything the modern world depends on. Aviation may have got the headlines this time, but it is far from the only sector at risk. As the Sun approaches the peak of its current cycle, these flares have begun nudging at the weak spots in our digital world. Back in the 1980s and 1990s, when satellite technology was still young, the worst that happened during a solar storm was patchy radio communication or occasional satellite drift. But today, we’ve wired the entire planet to depend on satellites for timing, navigation, communication, weather forecasting, surveillance, and even basic internet routing. With this level of interconnectedness, a significant solar flare isn’t merely a cosmic event. It’s a supply-chain shock, a financial-market hazard, and a national-security risk bundled together. Take GPS, for instance. The system relies on ultra-precise timing signals. A strong flare can distort these signals enough to throw off navigation by several meters. That’s dangerous for aircraft, but it also hurts shipping routes, farm equipment, and even Google Maps accuracy. When it comes to satellites, high-energy particles can fry onboard electronics, force operators to switch to backup batteries, or push satellites into temporary shutdowns. Starlink, for example, lost dozens of satellites in 2022 after a geomagnetic storm heated up the upper atmosphere and increased drag. And ground infrastructure isn’t immune either. Power grids can pick up excess current when the Earth’s magnetic field fluctuates. That’s exactly what happened in 1989 when a solar storm plunged Quebec into a nine-hour blackout. Apart from this, undersea internet cables, which carry over 95% of global data, rely on repeaters placed at regular intervals. These repeaters can malfunction when bombarded by electromagnetic interference. Even the global financial markets feel the ripple! High-frequency trading and international payments depend on GPS-synchronized timestamps. A slight timing drift can throw off settlement systems and even force exchanges to halt trades. So yes, in a nutshell, solar flares are bad for pretty much everything. But the good news is that we’re better prepared than we used to be. Forecasting models now give power operators and airlines at least a few hours’ warning before a major solar storm hits. Newer satellites come with better shielding and internal redundancy. Power grid engineers are also studying how to isolate vulnerable sections of the network (islanding) so a surge in one region doesn’t cascade across an entire grid. But the bigger question is whether these solutions can scale quickly enough. Much of the global communications and power backbone was built in a different era, when solar activity cycles were milder, and our dependency on digital systems was far lower. Upgrading satellites, modernizing grids, and hardening cables is expensive and slow. Yet the cost of ignoring the risk keeps rising. So yeah, the Airbus warning may have been short-lived, but it served as a timely wake-up call. A reminder that our digital world isn’t just vulnerable to hackers, outages, or geopolitical tensions. It’s also vulnerable to physics. And while we can patch software or tighten security protocols, we cannot negotiate with the Sun. So as solar activity escalates through 2025 and 2026, this may be the test that forces governments and companies to rethink how resilient our infrastructure really is. Until then… Liked this story?

Can LIC be India’s sovereign wealth fund? A sovereign wealth fund is state-owned, and it can invest in a basket of assets, generating returns for a country’s economy and people. And in a lot of ways, LIC behaves like India’s own sovereign wealth fund, but still technically can’t be classified as one. Yes, we have the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), but only 49% of it is owned by the government and the remaining 51% is held by institutional investors. Plus it also invests in infra projects for the country. On the other hand, LIC already invests in government bonds, equities, PSUs and every time the government needs a bailout, investors for an IPO or even to stabilise our markets, guess who steps in to fill the gap? LIC! So in our Monday story, we wrote about how and if LIC can be India’s sovereign wealth fund. You can read about it here . When ORS didn’t mean ORS Every time you came down with an upset tummy or a bout of vomiting from dehydration, your parents would head over to the pharmacy and grab a custom care kit of medicines and aid, including sometimes, a quiet lookalike ‘ORS’ drink. Except it wasn’t really ORS and for a long time, India was consuming and feeding these sugary drinks to treat dehydration, unaware that they weren’t really medicines. That’s why Dr. Shivaranjani Santosh started looking into it herself. She took it to court, to social media and fought against the companies that got away with it for years. But why did it take so long for us to recognise the difference between ORS, the life saver, and ‘ORS Drink’, the sugary drink? Find out in our Tuesday story here . India’s new Labour Codes explained It’s fair to say that a decent number of people make up the labour sector in India today. But despite that, we were still operating on outdated labour laws, with some even contradicting another. About 29 laws spread across different eras of India, companies scratching their heads figuring out which to follow, and employees who couldn’t access benefits. All that was supposed to change with the Labour Codes, broken down into 4 primary codes: The Code on Wages The Industrial Relations Code The Code on Social Security, and The Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions (OSH) Code. Four major codes that took a century of scattered laws, cleaned up for the new India: one that also counts gig workers. So what do these labour codes mean for you, your employer and the country? We break it down in our Wednesday story here . What's a smell trademark, anyway? India’s perfume market has a whole shadow world hiding inside it — a ₹500–1,000 crore universe of copycat scents that survives because of one odd loophole in trademark law. You can trademark a logo, a jingle, even a shape… but not a smell. And that tiny detail explains why dupes thrive. And it’s not just India. Even globally, fragrance trademarks don’t fly because the scent is the product. You can’t separate a perfume from its smell. That’s why Chanel once lost a battle over No. 5 in the UK. But a few days ago, a Japanese tyre company did the impossible. Sumitomo Rubber Industries actually secured a trademark for rose-scented tyres. How on earth did they pull that off? Check out Thursday’s Finshots newsletter to find out. Why Michael Burry is going short on AI A few weeks after closing Scion Asset Management, Michael Burry is back in the spotlight — not with another sensational trade, but with a warning. He believes the world’s most celebrated investment theme is quietly repeating the mistakes of the dot-com era: hyper-spending, shaky profitability, and accounting assumptions that make earnings look far healthier than reality. The numbers he lays out are staggering. The AI companies he’s pointing at are the biggest in the world. And this time, he’s not issuing his warnings through regulatory filings, he’s speaking directly. But Wall Street doesn’t seem convinced. Analysts are pushing back. Tech giants are defending their books. And investors are still pouring money in. What does Burry see that the market doesn’t? And why did it take shutting down his own fund to say it?

The Story This week delivered two big market milestones almost back to back. On 26th of November 2025, the NIFTY clawed its way back to 26,000 after a short spell of weakness. And just a day later, the SENSEX casually strolled past the 86,000 mark for the first time ever. As you’re reading this, both indices are either sitting at fresh all-time highs or hovering very close. But there’s a good chance that your portfolio may not be feeling much of this excitement. When you open your trading app, you’re probably not seeing a sea of green. Maybe it’s flat. Maybe it’s even bleeding a little. And that’s because while the blue-chip indices have inched up by about 6–7% over the past twelve months, the smaller pockets of the market haven’t kept pace. For context, the BSE Smallcap index is down 5%, and the Midcap index has managed a modest 2% return in the same period. This made us wonder, “If the markets are breaking records, why doesn’t it feel like it in your own portfolio?” For starters, the buzz around possible rate cuts — both from the US Fed and the RBI , has lifted market mood. Lower interest rates simply make it cheaper for companies to borrow, expand, and hopefully post better earnings. So global sentiment has swung upbeat, at least for now. But there’s something you shouldn’t miss. This rally in the blue-chip indices, especially the NIFTY, is deeply skewed. The rise isn’t broad-based at all. It’s been propped up by just a handful of heavyweight stocks, which can make the entire index look stronger than it actually is. To put that into perspective, only about a quarter of NIFTY stocks have contributed to nearly 80% of the 1,500-plus points the index has added since October! But a large chunk of NIFTY 50 names haven’t even hit new highs in 2025. A big part of what’s happening is something you’ve probably noticed in the headlines already. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) have dumped a record ₹2.67 lakh crore worth of Indian equities in 2025. And they’ve had their reasons. The India–US trade deal hasn’t moved smoothly, the dollar has been flexing its muscles, and early FY26 numbers from FII-heavy sectors like IT, private banks, and NBFCs have been underwhelming . When uncertainty piles up like this, investors instinctively retreat to safety. They pull money out of the riskier, more expensive small and mid-cap names and park it in the most liquid, stable large caps. And when money moves like that, it naturally flows into a handful of big stocks, lifting the index even if the rest of the market isn’t going anywhere. In fact, if you take an even closer look, the story becomes clearer. Among the quarter of NIFTY stocks driving the rally, just six heavyweights — Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, Bharti Airtel, SBI, L&T, and Axis Bank, have delivered nearly 60% of the index’s gains. And a big reason for this is the wave of foreign passive money being forced into names like HDFC Bank thanks to the quarterly reshuffle of the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) indices. Now, during this index rejig , MSCI isn’t just looking at a company’s market cap. It also checks how much of that stock is genuinely available for foreigners to buy. After the HDFC–HDFC Bank merger in 2023, foreign ownership in HDFC Bank shot up so close to the regulatory ceiling that there was barely any “room” left for new foreign investors. When that happens, MSCI cuts the stock’s weight, signalling that it’s harder to access. But in the past few quarters, foreign shareholding has dipped a little, opening up enough space for MSCI to restore HDFC Bank to its full weight. That means passive foreign funds — the kind that track MSCI indices, have no choice but to buy more. And this, analysts say, is expected to bring in roughly $2.5 billion into Indian equities, with a massive $1.8 billion flowing in due to HDFC Bank alone, thanks to this weight upgrade. There’s also the uncomfortable reality of a massive liquidity drain playing out in the market right now. In simple terms, retail investors — who were earlier heavily parked in small and mid-cap stocks (directly and through mutual funds), are quietly pulling money out. And instead of doubling down, they’re shifting to flexi-cap funds to spread their risk a bit more. Again, there could be three clear reasons behind this shuffle. First, valuations in the mid and small-cap space have stretched to the point where investors are getting jittery. A Moneycontrol analysis points out that the MidCap index is trading at 25 times one-year forward earnings, above its 10-year average of 23. The SmallCap index, at 23 times, is even more inflated compared to its long-term average of 18. So, when prices run ahead of fundamentals, retail investors tend to get nervous, and rightly so. Second, the IPO frenzy. Retail investors have poured ₹30,000 crore into IPOs in FY26 while simultaneously selling ₹4,700 crore worth of shares in the secondary market. This is their worst selling streak since FY19. And with over ₹76,000 crore worth of IPOs hitting the market just this month (November 2025), many retail and HNI investors have been offloading their mid and small-cap holdings to free up cash for fresh applications. The logic? Quick listing gains. It’s the classic “why wait for long-term returns when there’s a chance to make money next week?” mindset. And it’s not just IPOs. Even the pre-IPO market is buzzing, with investors piling into unlisted shares of soon-to-list companies hoping to ride the valuation premium. But to fund all of this, they’re selling what they already hold. That’s added a lot of selling pressure to the broader market, while the index heavyweights have barely flinched. And finally, gold and silver have been on a tear. With precious metals rallying, many investors have preferred the comfort of those shiny gains over the choppy fundamentals of smaller companies. Naturally, this has pulled even more money out of secondary markets. But what does all this really mean for the markets, you ask? Are we already in the middle of a bull run? In the very short term , maybe. The momentum looks strong. But that doesn’t automatically mean the bull run has strong legs. There are still plenty of moving pieces: overall valuations remain on the higher side, and even though the Russia–Ukraine peace accord has lifted sentiment, the situation is far from settled. So the market’s footing right now isn’t as firm as the headline numbers make it seem. So as an investor, the best thing you can do is stay calm and avoid getting swept up in the excitement. Don’t chase anything just because it’s rising. Markets have a way of reminding us that what shoots up can slide down just as quickly. So stick to your plan, avoid risky shortcuts like selling solid holdings for quick gains, and make sure you understand the fundamentals behind every move you make.

The Story Almost three weeks ago, Michael Burry, the short seller who bet against the housing market before the 2008 crisis, closed down his asset management company — Scion Asset Management. He deregistered the hedge fund on November 10, 2025, which officially meant he’d be stepping away from professional money management. When the company was closed, the news couldn’t help but speculate if the scion of Scion was actually going to retire, which is why he came out clean stating that he’s clearly not going to. That led to the next guessing game: Why did he step away and what comes next? It started with the new rules by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or America’s version of SEBI) — a tougher regulatory climate for registered investment advisors (RIAs) between 2023 and 2025. Things like mandatory quarterly fee reports, audited statements, a heavier paper trail of positions and higher transparency, combined with the fact that Michael Burry’s name packs a punch, meant he couldn’t do what hedge funds existed to do in the first place: Take quiet, asymmetric, unlikely bets without giving out your position. For a short seller (someone who bets a stock will fall and tries to profit when its price drops), that can mean everything. Each time his firm would file a disclosure, the media would make their own interpretations, which trickled down to smaller retail traders who like to copy-trade bigger players. That can move a stock irrationally. It made it impossible to operate the way he had all these years. And with that, he closed down the fund and started a new venture: a newsletter! That’s right. A few weeks into closing down his firm, Burry started his own newsletter, aptly called Cassandra Unchained . After his newfound freedom from regulatory filings, he started posting on Substack and X with the same warning: the AI boom is looking more and more like a bubble in the making, similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. His thesis is simple. The companies paving the path to AI — chipmakers, cloud giants, AI-computing companies and of course the infrastructure builders — are investing heavily to build the future. And because the hardware and software are so unique, they are also extremely expensive. Think billion-dollar data centres, massive computing clusters and GPUs whose long-term return on investment is still uncertain at this scale. He’s even given this a name: ‘ supply-side gluttony ’. Enormous spending chasing unproven economics. He argues that many AI-heavy firms are assuming their expensive GPUs and servers will last 5–6 years and are depreciating this hardware over that time frame, when in reality it may become outdated much sooner. And if he’s right, these firms are overstating their profits by as much as $176 billion between 2026 and 2028. But why does this matter? To answer that, let’s understand some basic depreciation. Say you run a cab company, and your fleet consists of cars that cost ₹10 lakh a unit. With the heavy use in the city, the car might be good for 5 years of use before its maintenance costs more than it brings in, and also before customers start complaining about it. By that logic, your depreciation costs should be about ₹2 lakh a year. But on paper, you suddenly claim the cars will last 10 years. Now you only show ₹1 lakh as the annual depreciation cost. The annual cost drops to ₹1 lakh and profits look much healthier, even though nothing has changed in cash terms. It all works fine until year five arrives and the car is actually at the end of its life, but your books pretend it has another five years left. But when the cards come crumbling down, the company has to take a huge hit to its balance sheet just to clean up this accounting. This is what Michael Burry was getting at when some tech companies suddenly doubled the useful life of their assets for depreciation. Hence the $176 billion figure. Sure, you could argue that today’s GPUs are built better. But the pace of AI progress is even faster, which means the hardware powering it can become obsolete much sooner than companies assume. From the outside, it might look like Michael Burry is shorting AI itself because the companies are so large. But he’s really betting against the pricing of the technology behind it. And history shows that big tech shifts don’t always reward investors equally. The dot-com era still has survivors, but most never delivered the returns investors had hoped for. Similarly, the rate at which current AI companies are building aggressively makes it look unlikely that investors will see returns or earnings to match. And even if they are to match it, earnings will have to grow at exponential rates in the coming years, while their customers have yet to show any sign of durable profits that will sustain such growth. This faultline is what he’s targeting. Now keeping that in mind, we also have the depreciation accounting factor. Meaning, many AI companies are stretching the useful life of their GPUs and servers, say from 3 years to 6 years. So their annual depreciation expense becomes smaller today. But if revenue drops in the future and investors start questioning these assumptions, companies may be forced to reset the useful life to something more realistic. When that happens, they must catch up on all the depreciation they delayed. That’s the “much higher depreciation costs all at once or a “double hit” that could shatter today’s belief in endless exponential profits. This is why Burry’s positioning makes sense to him. Shorting these stocks, in his view, puts him in the right place when stretched valuations finally collide with more realistic cash flows. But does this mean Burry is unquestionably right, you ask? Well, not everyone agrees. Nvidia, for one, pushed back strongly after Burry’s comments gained traction. The company argued that GPUs and AI servers remain useful for years and simply get shifted to less demanding tasks as they age. Analysts like Bernstein also say the debate isn’t settled yet. And that the real useful life could be longer, shorter, or simply too early to model with confidence. Yet Burry isn’t waiting for consensus. To him, the best asymmetric opportunities appear before the numbers settle. So realistically, one of two things might happen: AI monetisation and capital expenditure ramp up fast enough to justify today’s prices, giving bullish investors the win, or The pricing is too far ahead of fundamentals, and Burry’s contrarian bet pays off. Until then, the market will keep leaning one way, and Burry will keep leaning the other, making it a long short that only time can settle. Fun Fact: In Greek mythology, Cassandra was a priestess who could foresee disasters but was cursed so that no one believed her. After shutting down his asset management company and freeing himself from disclosure rules, Michael Burry named his newsletter Cassandra Unchained — a nod to both the myth and Warren Buffett’s idea of the “Cassandra Syndrome”, where market warnings are dismissed until it’s too late.

In today’s Finshots, we tell you how Japanese tyre-maker Sumitomo Rubber secured legal approval for a rose-scented tyre as a trademark — something no one had managed before in India. And why this unusual win could open the doors for a whole new category of sensory trademarks in the country. But here’s a quick note before we begin. If you’re someone who loves to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance, then hit subscribe if you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story. The Story India’s perfume market is worth around ₹4,500 crore . And roughly ₹2,000 crore of that sits in the unorganised segment. So if you were to estimate how big the market for perfume dupes or copycat fragrances really is, even a conservative assumption that half the unorganised segment consists of dupes leaves you with a ₹500–1,000 crore shadow market built purely on imitation scents. And the reason this parallel world thrives is because of one odd quirk in trademark law, not just in India, but in many parts of the world. You simply can’t trademark an intangible feature like smell or colour if that feature is the product itself. A classic example is from the luxury perfume world. Chanel once tried to trademark the scent of “No. 5” in the UK, and the authorities rejected it. Simply because, in perfume, the scent is the product. You can’t separate one from the other. It also explains why dupes are so common. If someone buys a Burberry fragrance and another person shows up wearing a ₹300 version that smells almost identical, Burberry can’t sue them for copying the fragrance. The smell alone can’t be protected unless the bottle or branding is also being faked. But that’s just one part of the nuance around non-conventional trademarks in India. And in case you’re wondering what “non-conventional” even means, it’s basically a trademark that isn’t a word or logo but still identifies a brand through some experience of it like shape, sound, colour or even smell. Now let’s come back to the nuance we were talking about. The Trade Marks Act defines a trademark as “a mark capable of being represented graphically and which is capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one person from those of others and may include the shape of goods, their packaging and combination of colours.” This simply means two things. One, a trademark must be shown visually in a clear graphical form. And two, it must be distinctive enough for customers to recognise where the product comes from. And this is exactly why smell trademarks have never taken off in India. First, smell is invisible. You can’t photograph it, draw it or attach it neatly to your application form. Which is why, for decades, people believed it was impossible to register an olfactory trademark in India. Second, some scents serve a functional purpose, which immediately disqualifies them. Take Fevicol. You can identify Fevicol by its fragrance, sure, but the company can’t trademark it because the scent is added to mask the adhesive’s natural odour. It improves the user experience, and according to law, anything functional can’t be trademarked. But then, a few days ago, one Japanese company, Sumitomo Rubber Industries, the folks behind Dunlop Tyres, managed something no one else in India had. It actually got legal approval for a rose-scented tyre as a trademark. Okay, we know that sounds a little bizarre. Who goes around smelling tyres, right? But we’ll come back to that. First, let’s see how Sumitomo even pulled this off. The story really begins with the biggest hurdle in trademark law — graphical representation. Sumitomo has been selling tyres with a floral fragrance for decades and wanted India to officially recognise that the scent belonged to them. But when they applied in 2023, the Trademark Registry rejected it on two grounds. One, the rose scent wasn’t distinctive enough to act as a trademark. And two, they hadn’t provided an acceptable graphical representation of the smell. Instead of backing off, Sumitomo went back to rework its application. They refined their arguments, and explored new ways to satisfy the law. And this eventually led to a critical shift: if the problem was visual representation, they needed science to turn the smell into something tangible on paper. This is where the breakthrough came . The company teamed up with three scientists from IIIT Allahabad who created something called a seven-dimensional olfactory vector. In simple terms, they analysed the rose fragrance and broke it down into seven measurable scent profiles — floral, fruity, woody, nutty, pungent, sweet and minty. Each was given a numerical value based on how strongly it appeared in the scent. Once they had all the numbers, they plotted them on a graph. Source: Trademarks Journal No. 2236, published on 24 November 2025 Suddenly, the smell became a measurable, permanent “fingerprint” instead of something subjective floating in the air. The Registrar could now see the fragrance in a fixed, objective form. The other major concern though, was distinctiveness. To prove that adding a rose scent to tyres isn’t functional in any way, Sumitomo argued that adding a floral scent to tyres doesn’t improve how they work. Tyres naturally smell like rubber, and a rose fragrance doesn’t make them more durable, efficient or safe. It simply acts as an identifier. And when someone unexpectedly smells roses from a passing vehicle, it creates an instant mental link with the brand. The Registrar found this convincing, especially because Sumitomo has been using this scent worldwide since 1995. And since this was India’s first-ever smell trademark application, the Registry wanted to be absolutely certain before breaking new ground. So it looked at how countries like the UK, the US, Europe and Australia already recognise and handle smell trademarks. There was also one more important legal point. India’s trademark law uses the word “includes” when defining what a mark is, not “consists only of.” That single word gives the law flexibility. It doesn’t limit trademarks to traditional forms. It leaves room for new ones, as long as they meet the existing conditions of graphical representation and distinctiveness. In other words, the law already allowed smell marks. Just that no one had cracked the representation problem until now. So yeah, that’s how Sumitomo flipped the problem on its head, turned a smell into science, and paved the way for India to finally register its first-ever smell trademark. But while that chapter closes, the story doesn’t end, because you’re probably wondering what a tyre company plans to do with a rose-scented trademark. How exactly does this help it sell more tyres? After all, most of us only smell tyres if we’re mechanics changing them or, in this rare case, if a rose-scented one happens to roll past us. And when people buy cars, they don’t really get to pick the tyres anyway. Sure, you can customise them, but who’s paying a premium for scented tyres? Unless a tyre improves operational efficiency, most buyers won’t bother swapping the default ones. Even carmakers have their own long-standing supply arrangements with tyre manufacturers, and a fragrance is hardly going to influence those deals. So why do this at all, you ask? Well, maybe Sumitomo is thinking way ahead. Imagine a world of driverless cars where the cabin experience becomes as important as the ride itself. In that future, even the ambient scent of tyres could add to the overall feel of the vehicle instead of relying solely on in-cabin perfumes. And securing the smell trademark today ensures competitors can’t use the same olfactory signature tomorrow. In the present, though, this move probably serves another purpose. It signals to investors that Sumitomo is experimenting with brand protection in fresh, non-traditional ways. And that kind of innovation always gets noticed. But one thing you can’t ignore is that it opens the door to an entirely new set of possibilities in smell trademarking, even for categories like fragrances. Who knows, maybe soon a luxury hotel chain will trademark a signature lobby scent to protect the ambience it’s known for. And watching how these new possibilities unfold is going to be quite interesting. Until then… Liked this story? Share it with your friends, family or even strangers on WhatsApp , LinkedIn , and X .

Now on to today’s story. The Story For decades, India’s labour laws mostly resembled a messy drawer, 29 separate Acts written across different eras, each with its own definitions, authorities, thresholds, and exemptions. Too many registrations, too many inspectors, too many grey areas. Companies struggled to comply, workers struggled to access benefits, and everyone struggled to know which rule applied when. So the government consolidated those 29 laws into four primary labour codes : The Code on Wages, The Industrial Relations Code, The Code on Social Security, and The Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions (OSH) Code. The idea wasn’t to reinvent the wheel. But to take a century’s worth of scattered legislation, strip out contradictions, unify definitions, reduce compliance, and extend coverage to the millions of workers who exist outside formal frameworks. The Second National Commission on Labour had suggested this years ago, and it’s finally becoming a reality because most states have finished drafting their rules. These codes touch almost every working Indian, full-time employees, factory workers, gig workers, platform workers, contract staff, and even tiny shops with a couple of assistants. They decide how your salary is structured, whether your take-home rises or falls, how your PF (Provident Fund or a mandatory retirement savings fund where you and your employer contribute, typically when the establishment has 20 or more employees) behaves, who qualifies as a “worker”, and what happens if someone loses a job or works in hazardous conditions. Let’s quickly decode the four codes before getting to the thorny bits. The Wages Code consolidates laws on minimum wages, payment of wages, bonus rules, and, more importantly, defines the term ‘wages’. This definition becomes the backbone for PF, gratuity (the lump sum your employer gives you as a thank you for long-term service), and social security contributions. Next, the Industrial Relations Code governs hiring, firing, layoffs, strikes, and dispute resolution. The focus is on improving labour flexibility while retaining safeguards for any disputes. The Social Security Code tries to stitch together PF, ESIC (a government-run health insurance scheme for salaried workers earning up to ₹21,000 a month), maternity benefits, gratuity, gig worker welfare, and more under one umbrella. It formally recognises gig and platform workers for the very first time. And finally, the OSH Code merges laws on safety, working conditions, contract labour, holidays, and health standards into a single playbook across industries. So, is this simplification a win for everyone? Not quite. And that’s where the tension begins. For employers, the new codes are supposed to make compliance cheaper and more predictable. The headline change is in the Industrial Relations Code: firms with up to 300 workers (up from 100 previously) can now lay off, retrench, or close operations without seeking prior government approval. This is meant to boost manufacturing appetite, help firms scale faster, and reduce the fear of adding permanent headcount. But unions see the exact change as a weakening of job security and a shift of bargaining power away from workers, and toward companies. Apart from this, another change is that gig and platform workers are finally included in India’s legal framework through the Social Security Code. On paper, this is historic. Aggregators must contribute a portion of revenue towards gig-worker welfare funds. But timelines, contribution formulas, and enforcement mechanisms remain fuzzy. And then comes the salary question, the one employees care about most. The most significant shift comes from the new definition of wages (or salary). The simple change is that allowances cannot exceed 50% of total compensation. So your basic pay now has to form at least half of your salary structure. Since PF and gratuity are calculated on basic pay, a higher basic means higher PF contributions. That’s good news for your retirement fund. But it may reduce your monthly take-home. Let’s say your CTC today is ₹1,00,000. Under the old structure, companies often kept basic pay at 30–40%, with the rest as allowances to reduce PF outgo. Here’s how it would look under the old and new regulations: Old structure: Basic: ₹35,000 Allowances: ₹65,000 PF (12% of basic): ₹4,200 Take-home: higher, because PF outgo is small. New structure (under 50% rule): Basic has to be at least ₹50,000 Allowances: ₹50,000 PF (12% of basic): ₹6,000 Take-home: lower, because PF contribution rises. Now, you may benefit in the long term, with a higher retirement fund. However, your take-home pay ultimately reduces. Employees gain in other areas too. Fixed-term workers can now receive gratuity after just one year of service, instead of having to wait five years earlier. The codes streamline inter-state migration by allowing easier portability of benefits, which is important in peak seasons when workers move states for jobs. Women can now also work night shifts, provided safety measures are in place, and grievance committees include female representation. Hazardous-work regulations are now stricter. The “one-worker rule” means even micro units with just one person on the payroll must follow safety rules. It prevents companies from sidestepping safety norms by staying small on paper. In practice, it means small workshops, contractors, and micro-factories must provide protective gear, follow basic procedures, and take responsibility for worker safety just like bigger firms. IT and IT-enabled services must pay their employees’ salaries within the first week of every month. But not every change will land the same way everywhere. Once the central government sets a national floor wage, states will have to adjust their own minimum wages accordingly. Some states may need to raise wages sharply, increasing costs for employers in low-income regions. Underpinning all this is the larger philosophical tension. The labour codes try to do two opposite things at once: modernise India’s labour market for a global, digital economy and protect workers from insecurity. More flexibility for businesses usually means less rigidity for labour. More portability and benefits for workers usually mean higher administrative overhead for employers. Somewhere in the middle lies the balance everyone is arguing about. So where does that leave us? India’s new labour codes promise a cleaner, more modern labour framework. If implemented well, employers could get more straightforward rules, workers could get stronger safety nets, and gig workers could finally get formal rights. But the trade-offs are real — lower take-home pay for many salaried employees, reduced job protection in some sectors, and uncertainty until every state actually enacts these codes. Think of these reforms not as a magic fix, but as an attempt to reboot a century-old system for a new economy. Whether they become a milestone or a missed opportunity depends entirely on execution. Until then… Everyone, employers, workers, and gig platforms, will be watching the fine print closely.

Now, on to today’s story. The Story It’s 10 am on a Saturday morning. Last night’s dinner didn’t sit well, meaning your child might have spent the morning vomiting or with an upset tummy. Every parent knows the drill. You rush to a pharmacy and ask for the only thing the World Health Organisation (WHO) says truly works: ORS . Sitting camouflaged in the middle of this apothecary of medicinal aids, is a harmless looking tetrapack with a printed picture of a fruit, with the tag ‘ORSL’. And even when you clearly ask the pharmacist to hand you an ‘ORS’, chances are they’d be giving you the ORS-adjacent products, unaware there’s a difference. For years, this is how many Indian parents ended up giving a sugar-filled drink to their children, unaware that they were just calling themselves ‘ORS’ or using clever wordplay to mimic the real thing. On the outside, they looked, sounded and even packaged themselves to look real, harmlessly sitting in every pharmacy in the country. The reality was that these weren’t really ORS. According to WHO, an ORS is an oral rehydration salt used to treat dehydration. Being dehydrated itself might sound harmless, but it’s not the ‘hot summer day’ or ‘5K run’ type we’re talking about. Think actual problems from bad food and other stomach issues, which are actually fatal among children 5 years old and below. And the problem was these sugary drinks were ORS impostors. The companies marketed them as something you could use for everyday rehydration, not necessarily for diarrhoea, which they conveniently wrote at the back of the pack. But let’s be honest, how many of us actually read labels carefully back then? So in a moment when the body desperately needed electrolytes and salts to recover, it ended up getting a flavoured sugary juice instead. And that only made things worse. At that point, your body knew something was wrong, but your mind was confused, because all the steps were followed: medicines on time, light food, hot water, the whole nine yards. So nobody could understand how or why things were going sideways. That’s when around 2016-17 , Dr. Shivaranjani Santosh started looking into it herself. The Hyderabad-based doctor was just one among the many doctors who saw parents giving children these drinks unknowingly. Those “ORS-adjacent” drinks also contained far more sugar than the WHO-recommended ORS formula. So this was not just mislabelling. The drinks were nowhere near what they mimicked. For context, according to WHO, an ORS should have just 1.35 grams of sugar per 100 ml. Those ORS-adjacent drinks had about 11 grams for the same quantity. Seeing this, Dr. Shivaranjani started her campaign around the same time and began filing RTI petitions, wrote to ministries, worked on public awareness and of course, approached the courts as well. In all that time, the pseudo ORS drinks were still allowed to be sold, showcased and self-labelled as an ‘ORS’. Imagine you’re in the shower on hair-wash day. In the steamy mist, your hand reaches for the shampoo… but you accidentally grab the conditioner instead. Normally, that’s just an annoying start to your morning. But in the case of ORSL-style drinks, the stakes were much higher than a bad hair day. Which leads to the real question: How were these drinks allowed to sit right next to certified medical-grade ORS in pharmacies? Well, it starts with the red tape. If you’re selling a WHO-standard medicinal aid or drug, then that product comes under the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) and the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. All drugs sold in India must be safe, effective and meet quality standards. That means to call something a medicinal product you need trials, testing, pre market approval, and registration. It’s what stops anyone from claiming what they’re selling is ‘medicine’ or therapeutic in nature. But since these weren’t registered medicinal products, (they were sold as “foods” despite calling themselves ‘ORS’) they didn’t have to follow those drug regulations. Instead they came under the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) as food items. Until very recently, that distinction wasn’t fully clear or enforced, even by regulators themselves. Complaints bounced between both regulators, slowing any outcome. This is what Dr. Santosh experienced in 2021–22 when she contacted CDSCO and posted on social media to keep the pressure up. To make matters even more confusing, FSSAI itself jumped back and forth. For instance, back in April 2022 the regulator issued its first strong warning about the misuse of “ORS” in drinks. Finally, FSSAI acknowledged the problem. That would have been the end of it, except just three months later in July they pulled back the order. The difference? The drink companies were allowed to continue using “ORS-style” branding with a small disclaimer. You’ve probably seen it: “This product is not an ORS formula as recommended by WHO.” Also, older brand owners who already had trademarks might still use the ORS-wording in their label. This set a dangerous precedent. Because guess who already owned these ORS-style trademarks? Large corporations with deep pockets. For instance, JNTL Consumer Health (Kenvue India, formerly part of Johnson & Johnson) already owned the brand “ORSL”, which fought hard to protect its trademark before the new rules came in. Even until the end, they fought tooth and nail to get that last batch, sized at about ₹180 crores, sold before the new rules came into effect. Another big brand, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, for its “Rebalanz VITORS” drink, also challenged FSSAI’s directives in court. Both approached courts, securing interim reliefs while they cleared the old stock away. This felt like a loss in a way, and it genuinely raised questions about food safety. But here’s why the courts allow this to happen. Usually, regulators don’t ban products overnight without giving the manufacturer a buffer period to sell old stock, provided they don’t produce and sell any more of it. This lessens the outcome of being sued by the manufacturer on grounds of legal reversal and unfair losses. And indeed, by the old rules the manufacturers were technically compliant. The old stock was made when the rules allowed them to, so they weren’t breaking any laws. But things like buffer period, pushback, and legal technicalities can’t delay what’s inevitable — the overall health of the public. After nearly eight years of warnings from doctors, complaints from parents, and repeated reminders that “ORS” is a life-saving medical formulation, the regulator finally acted decisively. In October 2025 , FSSAI issued what would become the turning point. It issued a landmark order withdrawing all earlier permissions that had allowed food and beverage products to use the term ‘ORS’ as a part of their branding. This time, the writing was as clear as day: No food or drink can use the term ‘ORS’ — whether as a trademark, prefix, suffix, or part of the product name, unless it meets the WHO-recommended ORS formulation, which is classified as a drug. But a ruling is only as strong as its enforcement. And the companies weren't ready to go down without a fight. Only this time, the Delhi High Court didn’t blink. About two weeks after FSSAI’s order, the court upheld the order. Public health, it seemed, won over corporate profits. In the weeks that followed the ruling, state authorities have started pulling the non-compliant products off shelves and e-commerce platforms. And there you have it, folks — the ORS saga. A messy eight-year ride, ending in a landmark win that doesn’t just fix one label. It sets the tone for how food safety will evolve in India. Until next time….. Fun Fact : The ORS formula that saves lives today was championed by Dr Dilip Mahalanabis during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. With almost no supplies and a raging cholera outbreak, he used a simple salt-sugar solution. WHO later adopted it worldwide.

https://finshots.in/archive/can-lic-be-indias-sovereign-wealth-fund,2025-11-24,Economy,Can LIC be India’s sovereign wealth fund?,"24 November 2025 • Economy Can LIC be India’s sovereign wealth fund? In today’s Finshots, we look at why India doesn’t have a sovereign wealth fund*, why some people think Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) already behaves like one, and why the truth is a lot trickier. But here’s a quick note before we begin. If you’re someone who loves to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance, then hit subscribe if you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story. The Story *Okay, before you jump in and say, “Hey Finshots, India does have a sovereign wealth fund. It’s called the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF)!”… let’s politely pause you right there. Because yes, you’re right, but only partially. NIIF was set up in 2015 as India’s first sovereign-anchored fund, with the government putting in an initial seed. Now, for the uninitiated, sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) are basically giant investment pools owned by governments. They’re funded by foreign-currency reserves or other government surpluses and are managed separately from the money used to run day-to-day government operations. But NIIF is a bit different. Think of it as a quasi-sovereign wealth vehicle that’s been tailored for India’s own needs. Instead of (primarily) chasing foreign acquisitions, the fund is mainly designed to invest in domestic infrastructure like roads, ports, renewables, logistics, the works. Today, NIIF manages about $5 billion across its funds. And here’s something else you should know. The government owns 49% of NIIF’s funds; the majority 51% comes from institutional investors. We’re talking names like HDFC, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, and global giants like ADIA, Temasek, and international pension funds. So in spirit, NIIF behaves less like a traditional SWF, which typically deploys state surplus globally and more like a capital-mobilising platform for India’s infrastructure story. Which is why, the Indian government recently floated an ambitious plan to create a $50 billion Bharat Sovereign Wealth Fund . A move that would place India alongside Singapore, Norway, the UAE, and other economies that deploy national savings into global markets and strengthen geopolitical influence. This announcement immediately set off debates. Where would the capital come from? Would it be fiscally prudent? And given India’s persistent trade deficit, does the country even generate the kind of surplus dollars that usually fund such investment vehicles? But this got a lot of people thinking, “If India wants a powerful, state-backed investment engine, why not use the giant it already has?” Unlike many nations, India has LIC — a financial colossus with a current AUM of over ₹50 lakh crore and growing. LIC already invests in government bonds, equities, PSUs, and even infrastructure bonds. Whenever the government needs a reliable anchor for an IPO, a backstop for a struggling bank, or a stabiliser during market stress, LIC often steps in. So LIC undeniably displays the traits of a sovereign investor. It has a massive capital base and the scale to take concentrated bets, precisely the traits an SWF needs. Countries like Singapore (Temasek) and Malaysia (Khazanah) use state-owned investment firms to shape national industrial strategy. On the surface, the logic fits. If they can do it, why can’t LIC? Well, it’s because LIC’s foundation is built on a completely different premise. You see, as we mentioned earlier, sovereign wealth funds are generally funded by national surpluses such as oil windfalls, export profits, fiscal savings, or excess foreign reserves. They deploy a country’s excess capital into productive assets. The risks they take are the state’s responsibility. And if something goes wrong, the cost eventually lands with the government, not individual citizens. LIC, by contrast, runs on policyholder money. Every rupee comes from families buying term insurance, retirement plans, and products for their long-term savings. LIC’s core mandate is fiduciary: protect capital, deliver stable returns, and honour claims. Its job is not nation-building gambles or “strategic” stake purchases that may or may not pay off. And this is where tension creeps in. Whenever the government nudges LIC to rescue a company, support disinvestment, or soak up PSU equity, LIC starts behaving like a de facto sovereign wealth fund, albeit without the transparency, safeguards, or autonomy that actual SWFs are built on. That poses two significant risks: Structural Mismatch: SWFs invest globally to generate foreign exchange income. India, however, has a widening trade deficit and has no meaningful surplus USD to deploy abroad. LIC isn’t designed to fill that gap. Its investments are predominantly domestic because its liabilities (future insurance payouts) are domestic too. Moreover, the regulations governing an insurance company’s use of policyholder premiums for investments are pretty strict. As per the Insurance Act, 1938 and its amendments, no insurer should invest, directly or indirectly, the funds of the policyholder outside India. Here is a list of the approved investments by the IRDAI. However, exceptions such as rupee-denominated bonds issued by multilateral bodies or incubators are allowed on a case-by-case basis, subject to explicit conditions. These also require approval from the IRDAI, the RBI, and compliance with FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act). This makes it all the more difficult for LIC to invest in global instruments. Governance Concerns: SWFs publish clear investment charters and detailed performance metrics. LIC, especially when executing decisions aligned with government priorities, remains opaque. If policyholder funds are used to support sensitive projects, it becomes difficult to judge whether those moves are financially sound or a case of mission drift. Just to be clear, LIC already does all this to some extent, but within the country. It’s already a heavyweight and can absolutely co-invest in national priorities. But that doesn’t make it a sovereign wealth fund. It makes it a large insurance company being stretched beyond its native design. Because at the end of the day, LIC’s first duty is to policyholders. That must stay intact. Its governance, risk frameworks, and investment criteria should remain insulated from external demands. If LIC ever participates in projects, it must do so under disclosed frameworks with risk caps. Then, we must build a dedicated SWF separately. This would require funds coming in from the right places. Not insurance premiums. And India has three such sources. The first is asset monetisation. The government owns airports, highways, ports, pipelines, mining rights, land banks, stakes in PSUs, and large pools of brownfield infrastructure that already generate stable cash flows. The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) is already in the business of selling or leasing these assets through disinvestment and monetisation pipelines. Instead of pushing all proceeds directly into the annual budget, a portion of these earnings could be channelled into a sovereign fund. Singapore built Temasek using exactly this model. The second source is foreign reserves, which today stands close to $700 billion . Many countries carve out a small surplus slice to deploy abroad through their SWFs. Even a cautious allocation of 1-2% of our reserves could seed an investable corpus without compromising RBI mandates. The third source is future fiscal surpluses. As the tax base widens and the deficit narrows, we could earmark a portion of its future windfall revenues, such as telecom spectrum receipts, strategic PSU stake sales, or the divestment of non-core government companies, for the fund instead of folding everything into annual spending. Norway’s fund ( Statens pensjonsfond ), for instance, started with oil money but today uses its taxes and licensing fees from oil companies to back its global investment book. A fund built on these foundations would be structurally different from LIC or any other domestic institution. It would be free to invest wherever it sees fit. From Silicon Valley tech to African infrastructure, Southeast Asian ports, energy assets, and venture capital, as well as stakes in domestic and global companies. It would be guided by an independent investment charter that prioritises returns, diversification, and future economic security over short-term political pressure. The bottom line is this: LIC can support national priorities, but it can’t replace a sovereign wealth fund. Its capital belongs to policyholders and shareholders, not the state. And until India has the surpluses to build an actual SWF, LIC must remain exactly what people signed up for, a safe, stable institution that protects lives, not an investment fund wearing an insurance company’s badge. Until then… PS: Here ’s an interesting resource from the IMF on how Norway built its SWF. Liked this story?

Hey folks! Earth might be known as the ‘blue planet’ because nearly 70% of its surface is water, but most of it isn’t fit for drinking. Oceans and seas make up 97% of all water — far too salty to drink, farm with, or use directly. Well… what if we could make all that seawater usable? That’s where desalination comes in: removing salt from seawater to get freshwater. In theory, it solves everything. But here’s the catch: it’s expensive. Think about your kitchen water purifier. It works beautifully when the input is river water or treated freshwater. But ask it to handle seawater and the energy costs would spike, the membranes would clog, and the filters would wear out within days. Now scale that up to an entire town, and desalination becomes a money pit — high-pressure pumps, RO membranes, electricity bills, and constant maintenance. Salt damages everything it touches. In regions with extremely high salinity, the equipment may not even work reliably. So yes, desalination works, but not without dehydrating your wallet first! And that’s where IIT-Bombay and Monash University’s research comes in. They’ve created a highly efficient, two-faced Janus film, officially called NCF@PH . So what does it do exactly? Traditional systems rely on reverse osmosis, forcing seawater through a membrane using high pressure. And as salinity increases, so do pressure and costs. Which is why the researchers wanted something that doesn’t use pressure at all. Their solution is a solar-powered system called SunSpring. This engineered material produces 18 litres of freshwater per square meter everyday, more than 2 times that of regular systems which make about 7 litres of water per square meter. It does this by having 2 faces — a sun facing side that captures sunlight efficiently, and a water facing side that lets the water vapour pass through it. There’s another clever detail. Traditional solar stills use the same glass surface to admit sunlight and condense vapour. Once droplets form, they block light and reduce heating. SunSpring avoids this by separating the jobs. Evaporation happens at the film; condensation happens on a Peltier cooler — a device that becomes cold when powered. This keeps the glass clear and the heating uninterrupted. Since this is still a prototype, Professor Subramaniam Chandramouli of IIT-Bombay says it costs three times as much as a regular RO system. But once production goes factory level, it should bring prices down. So for the time being, it’s being deployed where it’s needed most: at a school where the children can get 300 litres of pure water per day. And if all goes well, we might even see a pilot plant where it can shine best: Rann of Kutch, one of the most saline regions in India. Interesting, isn’t it? Here’s a soundtrack to put you in the mood 🎵 i wrote you a song by Tanmay Arora You can thank our reader, Simran Verma, for this beautiful rec! Ready to roll? What caught our eye this week 👀 Why does India neglect its lesser known heritage? What’s common between George Orwell and Bankim Chandra Chatterjee? You could say they were both celebrated writers. And you’d be absolutely right. But there’s something else too. They were born in the British Bengal Presidency. And the homes where they spent small but significant slices of their lives are falling apart today, despite supposedly being under government care as heritage sites. Let’s start with Orwell. Born Eric Arthur Blair in Motihari, in Bihar’s East Champaran district, he spent just about a year there before his mother took him and his sister back to England. His father, a British officer, worked in the Opium Department during colonial rule. And while the birthplace of the man who wrote Animal Farm and 1984 should ideally be something Bihar proudly preserves, the reality is sadly the opposite . The building’s roof has caved in. Birds, insects, and snakes, everyone seems to have claimed their own corner. Cows and pigs stroll in whenever they please, and the whole place looks eerily like, well, an actual animal farm. Irony just writes itself sometimes. Most people in Bihar barely know Orwell existed , let alone that he shaped modern English literature. And the state government, despite bearing responsibility for its upkeep, simply does not have the time, money, or attention to spare. It’s just another forgotten structure in a state grappling with poverty, unemployment, and a broken education system. The other house that recently made headlines is in West Bengal — Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s ancestral home in Naihati, where he wrote Vande Mataram, a composition that went on to become the national song. It’s supposed to be preserved by the state government. Yet neglect shows up everywhere. Peeling paint, seepage-stained walls, dim lighting and no proper air conditioning to protect artifacts. Ironically again, India marked 150 years of Vande Mataram just a few weeks ago, celebrating the very legacy this house represents. Now, here’s the thing. Technically, the state government insists that the house isn’t in ruins, and there’s a political disagreement around this between the Centre and the State. But that’s not Finshots’ lane, so we’ll park that conversation aside. Instead, what’s really got us thinking is this. Why do heritage sites remain neglected even after being declared heritage sites, and even when they could draw tourism? One big reason is funding. Look, India’s heritage conservation is chronically under financed. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), which looks after 3,695 centrally protected monuments, got just ₹1,270 crore for FY26. That’s only about 0.08% of total government expenditure. Break it down and it’s roughly ₹34.5 lakh a year per monument. That isn’t nearly enough to restore, secure, maintain, and modernise thousands of old structures. Between 2010 and 2023, ASI’s budget barely moved in the ₹1,200-₹1,500 crore range, even as inflation rose and buildings aged. Meanwhile, the Culture Ministry budget is spread thin across dozens of museums, academies, libraries, and cultural institutions. So if centrally protected monuments are stretched this thin, imagine what happens to state-level heritage buildings. Their archaeology departments rely on fragmented funding, irregular grants, and political priorities. If a site doesn’t promise tourism potential, funding often dries up before it arrives. Then there’s the classic maze of bureaucracy. Multiple agencies, paperwork loops, and endless approvals drag processes out for years. A CAG report once found that 70% of ASI monuments were in “neglected condition” largely because of administrative delays. And the same slowdown plays out across states. Even Bankim Chatterjee’s house took years to simply get heritage status , because officials had to prove that the structure held “architectural value”, even though history itself was the real value. And of course, manpower. In Bihar, officials admit that Orwell’s house isn’t a priority right now because they have too many other projects underway and too few people to execute them. Naturally, sites generating more tourist footfall get faster attention because preservation also needs revenues to justify itself. Like Orwell wrote , “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.” Turns out, heritage sites follow the same rulebook. So yeah, while the political blame games rage on and budgets stretch thinner each year, these quiet old homes are left to weather time on their own. They wait silently, hoping someone will notice before it’s too late. Whether they’ll eventually get a second life is something we’ll just have to wait and see.

Why Softbank sold its golden goose Masayoshi Son has always believed in an “AI Singularity”, and that vision turned SoftBank into one of the biggest backers of the AI boom. Which is why everyone paused when SoftBank suddenly sold its entire Nvidia stake, the very stock powering the revolution Son has championed for years. Did he believe that Nvidia’s stock had reached its peak value? Was an AI bubble forming? Or was something else quietly unfolding? Because the twist is… the money didn’t go away. It went right back into AI, including OpenAI’s ambitious ‘Stargate’ project. If this has you curious, the full story in our Monday newsletter breaks it down. Click here to read it . Making sense of India's first ever LPG import deal with the US Every time you make your morning chai, chances are the flame comes from an LPG cylinder, just like 62% of Indian homes. But here’s the interesting bit. India prefers LPG with more butane, and the Middle East is the only region that naturally produces this mix. That’s why we’ve depended on them for years. So when India suddenly signed its first long-term structured LPG deal with the US, whose gas is propane dominant and much farther away, it raised a lot of eyebrows. So why are we suddenly switching things up? And what does this mean for our kitchens, our energy security, and even our wallets? Tuesday’s newsletter breaks it down. You can read it here . The battle for BYJU’s remains Just three years ago, BYJU’s was India’s edtech superstar, worth $22 billion, buying companies left and right, and plastered across cricket jerseys. Today, its parent company is bankrupt. But here’s the twist. Instead of scaring everyone away, the insolvency has actually attracted big players like UpGrad and the Manipal Group. Why? Because buried under the chaos are two surprisingly strong businesses — Aakash and Great Learning. And investors want them at a bargain. But grabbing those “good mangoes” won’t be easy, thanks to a complicated insolvency battle and lenders who hold all the power. You can read the full scoop in Wednesday’s newsletter here . The Coin Laundry explained Crypto was supposed to be a financial revolution. No banks, no borders, just instant money movement. But as it turns out, that same freedom opened the door to something far messier. A massive global investigation has now revealed how billions were quietly laundered through major crypto exchanges, including several in India, and how everyday users got caught in the crossfire without even realising it. So how did a technology built on transparency become a paradise for hidden transactions? And why couldn’t exchanges spot what was happening right under their nose?

Understanding the economics behind India’s egg prices Namakkal, India’s “Egg Capital”, is suddenly in the spotlight after egg prices there hit ₹6 per piece for the first time ever.

If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story. The Story Namakkal, a district in Tamil Nadu, is widely recognised as the Egg Capital of India. It produces about 6 crore eggs every day, and over 10% of these are exported. And prices of eggs in the Egg Capital have hit the ₹6 mark for the very first time. For context, each egg now costs ₹6.05 at Namakkal’s poultry farms versus last year’s highest rate of ₹5.95. This means that buying eggs next time might cost you a little extra. So we thought, why not dive into how eggs are priced in India and why egg prices have hit record highs right now? And before you think, “Why should I know all this?”, remember, the egg industry is central to India’s economy and export story. The country ranks second globally in total egg production, producing over 14,200 crore eggs annually. And Namakkal accounts for a large share of India’s egg exports, close to 80–90% depending on the year. Which is why this story matters. At the centre of this entire pricing puzzle is the National Egg Coordination Committee (NECC), a non-government, farmer-driven cooperative-style body that plays a huge role in price discovery. And if NECC doesn’t ring a bell, maybe the ad jingle from the 1990s will: “Sunday ho ya Monday, roz khao ande”, which translates to “whether it’s Sunday or Monday, eat eggs every day.” This jingle was pushed out by the advertising agency working with NECC, all in the hope that Indians would warm up to eggs and eat them more often. And there’s a fun little backstory behind why NECC even felt the need to popularise eggs in the first place. Back in the late 1970s and early 1980s, egg prices in India had fallen below production costs. At the time, traders, not farmers, determined prices. They often ignored production costs or demand-supply realities and would buy eggs at artificially low rates. They’d then dump them into cold storage, and release them during peak seasons. And when farmers would try to raise prices during high-demand months, traders would simply refuse to buy from them because they already had stockpiles. With no price-stabilising mechanism, farmers were stuck in a vicious cycle. For context, between 1979 and 1981, the cost of inputs, especially feed, shot up by over 250%, but the price of eggs barely moved. Thousands of poultry farmers went bankrupt and many had to shut shop. Enter Dr. B. V. Rao, the founder of Venkateshwara Hatcheries — or, as you probably know it, Venky’s. Inspired by how Dr. Verghese Kurien revolutionised India’s dairy industry , he wanted to do the same for eggs. He travelled across the country, brought farmers together, helped them meet traders and policymakers, and tried to unite a fragmented sector. His goal was simple — create collective bargaining strength to prevent catastrophic price collapses. This eventually led to the creation of a common platform called the NECC. In 1982, NECC declared its first official egg prices. And from that day, it became a price-discovery platform that protected farmers from manipulation and helped ensure they received fair, stable prices. But fairness wasn’t enough. Back then, Indians weren’t eating enough eggs due to myths like they were “heaty”, “unhealthy”, “not meant for summers”, and so on. So NECC also took on the job of boosting consumption. The ad campaign that followed — “Sunday ho ya Monday…”, became iconic, and many countries later replicated the model. All of this helped NECC become the industry’s central price-setting voice. As of 2022, NECC had over 25,000 farmer members , and it set prices through a zonal system. Zonal committees met frequently and considered supply, demand, input costs such as feed, labour, electricity, veterinary costs, and local consumption patterns to arrive at daily price declarations. But here’s the catch. Even though NECC revolutionised the industry, it wasn’t a government body. It had no legal authority to fix prices. Its prices were meant to be advisory, not binding. But that wasn’t how things turned out. In 2022, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) pulled up NECC for exactly this reason. CCI found that while NECC called its prices “declared rates”, the industry treated them as mandatory. Zonal heads coordinated on WhatsApp and phone calls, farmers were discouraged from selling below NECC rates, and there were even informal threats of penalties. NECC also urged farmers to cull flocks early (essentially reducing the number of birds, sometimes even healthy ones, to cut supply) or hold back eggs in storage during low-demand periods to prevent prices from falling. And CCI wasn’t having any of this. It concluded that these actions amounted to cartel-like price-fixing, which is illegal. After which NECC could continue sharing price data, but had to clearly state that its prices were only suggestions, and farmers were free to choose their own rates. The thing, however, is this. When 25,000 farmers in a concentrated sector follow the same platform, “suggested prices” naturally become de facto market prices. Retailers can’t really buy outside NECC-aligned sources without losing access to the bulk of the supply. Sure, some regions operate outside NECC’s ecosystem and some commercial or small farms independently set prices. But broadly, NECC still shapes the market. And now that you know exactly how egg pricing works in India and why it works this way, that brings us back to Namakkal. Namakkal is technically the export hub, with over 1,000 producer members, even though Andhra Pradesh is India’s largest egg producer, contributing nearly 18% of the country’s output. And that’s simply because Namakkal sits much closer to ports like Thoothukudi and Kochi. Its eggs reach Middle Eastern markets in about four days — far quicker than the roughly two weeks it takes from Andhra Pradesh, which is also why the benchmark price from Namakkal carries weight. And right now, Namakkal’s benchmark price has hit record highs for a few reasons. For one, production has dropped. Continuous rains this year moistened and damaged feed , especially maize brought in from neighbouring states, causing fungal infections. Since feed quality directly affects output, production fell by roughly 7–10%. At the same time, demand has shot up. Winter naturally pushes people to eat more eggs, everyday consumption rises, and bakeries ramp up production for cakes, cookies, and festive desserts, adding another 20–30 lakh eggs a day during Christmas and New Year. And that’s enough to push prices up, especially when production is already struggling. And maybe the protein craze in India has added a bit of fuel to the fire too. Eggs are still the cheapest source of protein around. One regular egg gives you about 5–6 grams of protein, which works out to roughly ₹1 per gram (even at a higher retail price of ₹8) — far more affordable than pricey protein powders that not everyone can buy. And with nearly a quarter of India eating eggs, that extra demand definitely shows up. But while this benchmark price rise is great on paper for poultry farmers, it’s not exactly a windfall. Their production cost in Namakkal sits around ₹4.50–4.75 per egg , which means they’re still operating on pretty thin margins even at ₹6 a piece. So how do we improve their margins, you ask? One way is to reduce volatility in feed costs. Feed accounts for 60–70% of total production expenses, with maize and soybean meal as the core ingredients. Unlike farmers in developed markets who hedge feed prices through commodity futures (basically, advance contracts that let them lock in today’s feed prices for future use), Indian farmers have no hedging mechanisms. If the government creates support frameworks or stabilisation policies for feed, similar to MSP (Minimum Support Price)-style systems used for grains in some states, it could help protect farmers during volatile seasons. Another problem we’d need to tackle is disease management. India follows a “detect and cull” policy for avian influenza rather than preventive vaccination, unlike Europe or the US. This means every outbreak risks mass culling and productivity loss. Vaccination can mitigate this, and the government has begun moving in this direction. And hopefully, these measures will finally give farmers some breathing room with better margins, steadier incomes, and the comfort of knowing that they’re getting a fair price for the eggs they work so hard to produce.

The Story For decades, cryptocurrencies grew on the idea of freedom. Crypto exchanges understood this and made it easier for anyone to enter. You download an app, get verified almost instantly, and suddenly you can send money anywhere in the world within seconds. No forex fees, no gatekeeping, no tedious paperwork. It felt like a financial revolution. One where banks no longer played middlemen and anyone could move money across borders. That was the big promise of blockchain. But that freedom came with a catch. It didn’t matter whether you were a saint or a sinner. Because behind the polished app interface, quick digital KYC (Know Your Customer), and the promise of borderless money, something darker was happening. The more freely money could move, the more attractive it became to the wrong crowd. And gradually, money laundering found a new playground. Criminal syndicates, cyber scammers, and even state-backed hacker groups began using crypto exchanges around the world to move illicit funds. And the numbers weren’t small. A cross-border investigation led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) uncovered how billions of dollars were flowing through global exchanges like Binance and OKX, and even Indian exchanges like CoinSwitch, WazirX, ZebPay and more. Suddenly this wasn’t just speculation. The investigation showed the world just how deep the problem ran. And because this was a joint investigation, The Indian Express worked with the ICIJ and found close to 27 Indian exchanges involved, with around ₹623 crores siphoned off over two years from about 2,900 victims. But how did money laundering become so mainstream and why were the exchanges quiet? To understand that, you need to know how blockchain works. From the start, the lure of cryptocurrency’s explosive growth has been decentralisation. Picture a traditional ledger or an accountant’s book where all the entries are stored in one place, controlled by one person. They can change entries, hide mistakes, and no one else would know. This creates plenty of scope for manipulation. The blockchain flips this idea. Think of a digital ledger shared across thousands of computers around the world. Every transaction becomes part of a “block”, and those blocks link together to form the blockchain. But here’s the thing. Unlike a traditional ledger, you can’t rewrite or delete entries. It’s an immutable record. And that was the whole point of blockchains. But that’s what made them irresistible to criminal networks. When no one controls the ledger, and no central authority can block a transaction, suspicious transfers often can’t be stopped or reversed. Combine that with the ability to create unlimited wallet addresses, and it becomes the perfect tool for hiding funds. Over ten months, the ICIJ and 37 global media partners, collectively called The Coin Laundry team, uncovered thousands of transactions routed through major platforms that had direct links to criminal networks. The trail, however, began earlier. In 2023 , Binance pleaded guilty in the US for failing to maintain proper anti-money-laundering controls. Regulators accused it of allowing transactions connected to terrorist groups and cybercriminals. Changpeng Zhao stepped down as CEO, and Binance agreed to overhaul its compliance systems. Around the same time, OKX admitted to operating as an unlicensed money transmitter for seven years. It was fined $500 million by the US Department of Justice and forced to bring in a court-mandated compliance consultant. But even with new oversight, illicit flows continued. Investigators later found that the platform had received $161 million from Huione, a Cambodia-based network allegedly used by Chinese crime syndicates. In total, about $600 million flowed through Binance and OKX alone, despite fines on the exchanges. The investigation also uncovered roughly 35,000 wallet addresses that were linked to these flows to collect funds from clients. But it’s not just crime syndicates that have resorted to crypto. Take North Korea, which allegedly stole about $1.5 billion in cryptocurrency from Bybit, a Dubai based exchange. For a country as heavily sanctioned as it is, blockchain offered a loophole that no international court or law enforcement agency could fully close. In India, at least 27 exchanges have been flagged as mediums for money laundering, amounting up to ₹623 crores. Here’s how it happened. A user signs up on a crypto platform, thinking they’re buying genuine tokens and hoping for high returns. They deposit real money into a wallet on the platform. But in many fraud cases, the scam platforms were quietly converting the victims’ deposits into cryptocurrency without their knowledge and routing it through multiple wallets to hide its origins. This process, called layering, is one of the most common steps in laundering money through crypto. It exposed the huge gap between regulation and reality, and showed how regular users often end up holding the short end of the stick. Which brings us to the inevitable question: why can’t anyone stop them? Compare a regular stock exchange with a crypto platform and the differences become obvious. A crypto exchange can register in one country, onboard customers from another, and move funds through mixers across dozens of jurisdictions. For the uninitiated, a crypto mixer is a service that takes many users’ cryptocurrency, blends it together, and redistributes it to new wallet addresses, making it far harder to trace where funds came from or where they went. So even if authorities track a suspicious wallet, the money may have bounced across continents by the time they catch up. Which brings us to the next problem. The investigation found that even when exchanges complied with court orders, their systems weren’t equipped to trace the sheer number of wallets and transactions. Think less “needle in a haystack” and more “suspicious hay stick in a hay farm”. And unlike regular stock exchanges, crypto platforms can simply pick countries with lighter scrutiny. With some nations embracing crypto and others banning it outright, you end up with a patchwork of grey zones where platforms face fewer questions. Some do it for tax reasons too. India’s Finance Ministry found that 17 crypto exchanges evaded GST worth ₹824 crores, of which only ₹122 crores had been recovered by December 2024. Now that makes you wonder, where do we go from here? There’s plenty of talk about regulation, but honestly, the first line of defence is awareness. Chances are we all know at least one ‘crypto bro’ who can pitch ten coins in under a minute, but ask them how blockchain works and it’s radio silence. That’s because regulation only goes as far as the parties involved. Even if exchanges comply, they can’t save every user from fraud. Crypto isn’t like a bank account where a mistaken transfer can be reversed. It’s decentralised, irreversible, and extremely technical. And because of that, the people who know the least often lose the most. This is why exchanges need stricter penalties for operating with poor compliance. Real-time monitoring — the kind Binance and OKX agreed to — should become a global standard. Not because crypto is dangerous, but because the risks demand stronger guardrails than traditional markets. For users, due diligence matters. Study the tokens you buy, just like you would stocks or mutual funds. In equities, you look at real businesses and real value. Crypto should be no different. And just like you’d check whether a brokerage is licensed before opening a demat account, you should check whether a crypto exchange is regulated (again, that’s still a grey zone in India), compliant, and trustworthy. In a world where exchanges can pop up overnight, this step becomes even more crucial. The big question now is whether crypto exchanges can truly reform or whether the broader system needs a rethink to prevent becoming a global laundering pipeline. Because even if exchanges tighten compliance and regulators write new rules, the underlying architecture remains the same: decentralised, borderless, irreversible. Built for freedom, not policing. And that’s where awareness comes in. You need to know what you’re buying, how exchanges work, and why the red flags in crypto look different from those in traditional markets. Education doesn’t eliminate crime. But it protects you from becoming collateral damage in someone else’s laundering scheme.

The Story Over three years ago, Think & Learn Private Ltd, the parent company of BYJU’s was the crown jewel of India’s edtech ecosystem. At one point, it was the most valuable startup in India, valued at about $22 billion . Everyone had heard of or seen BYJU’s. Even India’s cricket team had ‘BYJUs’ splashed across its jerseys. Confident in its dominance, the company went about on an acquisition spree, snapping up firms like Whitehat Jr, Great Learning, Aakash etc, one after the other. This was BYJU’s broader goal of expanding aggressively in the K-12 learning sector, and with these acquisitions, they’d also enter test prep and upskilling services. BYJU’s even planned on expanding its business to North America, which is one of the reasons why it secured a massive $1.2 billion term loan in November 2021. This rapid expansion wasn’t by accident. You see, after the pandemic, BYJU’s saw the opportunity for growth in the learning industry. From K-12, it wanted to become an educational super-app where you would learn from your school level to advanced test prep like NEET, JEE and even IAS exams and no company was offering everything under one umbrella. So the logic was to scale fast and dominate early. But that loan came with strings attached — audited financials, credit ratings, disclosures and more. It wasn’t free money and it was also much more than the initial ask of $700 million. As time passed, the missteps of the company began piling up. For starters, the audited statements arrived with an 18 month delay and after the ministry of corporate affairs had to write to BYJUs. Its auditor raised concerns about how BYJU’s recognised its revenues. When the FY21 filings would arrive, it showed a massive loss of about ₹4,588 crores . This was the moment when that ‘hypergrowth’ locked horns with the reality of operations. The delayed filing would lead to lenders asking BYJU’s to repay the loan immediately, because to them, BYJU’s had breached the agreement of the loan. What followed was a battle between lenders and BYJU’s, auditing concerns, corporate governance issues and all the while customers (parents of BYJU’s students) started complaining about the aggressive selling practices like mis-selling that plagued the company. Even employees' salaries weren’t paid, and at the start of this year, the parent company TLPL was pushed into the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP). Translation: BYJU’s is effectively defunct. On paper, it looked like another ed-tech startup that burned too quickly after the pandemic. As schools reopened, demand for online learning plummeted and that looked like the last chapter. But something unexpected happened. The insolvency should have scared off any buyers from investing or taking over the firm. The reputational damage, not to mention the long list of issues with the company, would be enough to send any investor running the other way. Instead, the insolvency announcement brought in an expression of interest (EOI) from two major players in the edtech sector: Ronnie Screwwala of UpGrad and Manipal Education and Medical (MEMG) Group’s Ranjan Pai, which already own a stake in Aakash Educational Services. Sidenote: An Expression of Interest (EOI) is an official document that shows interest of a company or person to take part in a professional opportunity, which in this case, was the takeover of TLPL Ltd. Now their EOIs genuinely raised some questions, with the most important being: Why would serious players in the edtech space, who have enough reason to stay away from TLPL, want to acquire the bankrupt edtech company? On the surface, the brand had taken a beating and its finances were wrecked. But for UpGrad and MEMG, this takeover wasn’t about rescuing BYJU’s: it was about the two assets beneath the wreck that kept their shine: Aakash Educational Services and Great Learning. The paradox was written on the wall: While TLPL drowns, its assets are still bringing in investors. Think of a failing company’s assets like mangoes at a fruit market. On day 1, when the mangoes are fresh and perfectly ripe, they command a premium price. Everybody wants them, and sellers can charge a premium. If you want the best, you pay the best. But give that same stall a couple of days. The mangoes don't look as fresh as they used to, the skin wrinkles and fruit softens. The seller needs to sell it all before it spoils and they know they can’t charge the same price as day 1. Now, suddenly you as the buyer have all the bargaining power. And here’s the key: Even though they look a little bruised on the outside, many of the mangoes inside are still perfectly good — sweet, usable, and worth buying. That’s what happens in insolvency. On the outside, the company looks like it’s going bad, be it the brand, the finances or the debt. But on the inside, some assets like Great Learning and Aakash still look like high quality high value assets. This collapse simply allows investors to buy these assets at a discounted price so in reality, they’re not buying a bad batch of mangoes, they’re just picking the good ones inside on a clearance sale price. For the Manipal Group, it was more about buying up stake in Aakash Educational Services , where it is already a majority stakeholder. They became the largest shareholder in 2024 and if this bid turns out to be successful, they’d get to own the profitable offline institute at a fairer value. So far, the group has submitted two EOIs for TLPL, and for a while, it was the sole bidder until UpGrad entered the picture. You see, for UpGrad, the value lies in the K-12 learning segment, along with Aakash and Great Learning. A few weeks ago, they were in talks to takeover Unacademy , another test-prep platform for a valuation of $300 million, a tenth of its peak valuation of $3 billion in 2021. Adding BYJU’s assets would strengthen their position in India’s learning industry, with little to no competition. Whatever vision BYJU’s had, the competition seems to be taking forward. And that’s where the value in these acquisitions lie: Not in the BYJU’s brand, but the pieces that are still worth saving today. Yet the road ahead isn’t as easy as it looks. Because insolvency proceedings take time, and behind them are thousands of investors and stakeholders waiting for their dues. So let’s circle back to the mangoes for a moment. When you agree to buy the slightly old batch from the seller, you’re also agreeing to take the parts that are bruised, shrivelled, or unusable. That’s part of the bargain. Sellers rarely agree to hand over only the best pieces — because from their perspective, the entire lot needs to be sold, and the leftovers have no value to them. At the insolvency court, GLAS Trust Company is representing BYJU’s term loan B lenders, and their claim is the single largest of them all, tied to the $1.2 billion loan issued back in November 2021. The founders have contested this voting share, but GLAS Trust remains as the biggest voice of the insolvency proceedings. In insolvency, the biggest claim usually gets the loudest voice, which means that GLAS has veto power over the Committee of Creditors (CoC) - the panel of lenders who decide the fate of the company. So even if UpGrad and the Manipal Group want the crown jewels, the final say doesn't lie with them - it’s with the CoC. Because in an insolvency process, the CoC doesn’t see offers based on the bidder, it’s based on which proposal recovers the most money for creditors. Here that’s not just the investors, it’s lenders and employees who haven’t seen salaries for a while. So for now, all eyes are on the insolvency proceedings. Aakash and Great Learning may survive; TLPL may not. And only time will tell who walks away with what’s left.

Compete in 3 rounds to solve real-world business problems and receive cash prizes worth ₹2.25 lakh, Pre-Placement Interviews, Exclusive Goodies and a lot more! Click here to know more about the competition and apply. Now, on to today’s story. The Story You’ve probably already heard this by now. Digital gold is unregulated. That’s the alarm, market regulator SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) sounded last weekend . Its message was simple. Digital gold doesn’t count as a security like a stock. Nor does it qualify as a commodity derivative like gold futures, where traders agree to buy gold at a pre-decided price on a future date, hoping that the price increases. And since digital gold doesn’t fit into either of these buckets, SEBI can’t regulate it. Neither can the RBI (Reserve Bank of India), because it’s not a banking, deposit, or payment product. It doesn’t neatly fit into anyone’s rulebook. It’s just a digital way of buying gold, sitting outside every existing category. So when you open an app and tap the “buy digital gold” button, you’re basically trusting the platform to take your money and store an equivalent amount of physical gold for you in a vault somewhere. And if everyone who’s ever bought digital gold suddenly says, “Hey, I want delivery of my gold” or “I want to redeem”, the platform should ideally have enough gold to honour those requests instantly. Which is also where the precise problem lies. These platforms operate like regular businesses. They don’t fall under any financial regulator. There’s no law that forces them to disclose how much gold they’re holding, whether it matches customer balances, or whether the storage is fully backed at all times. Some claim to undergo audits, but nothing is mandated. So if even one major platform hasn’t actually stocked the gold it promised, and people start redeeming in large numbers, we might find ourselves dealing with a crisis we didn’t see coming. But then, it made us wonder, “Digital gold has been around in India for over a decade. So, if it’s unregulated, how did it manage to grow this big without anyone stepping in?” Well, to get to the bottom of that, we’ll have to understand how digital gold investments proliferated in the first place. In 2012, Augmont , a company dealing in precious metals from refining to retailing, began experimenting with digital ways of selling gold in India. At that time, the only two practical ways to invest in gold were to buy it physically or invest in gold ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds). These ETFs track gold prices by holding physical gold in secure vaults, and trade on stock exchanges just like stocks. Basically, they’re a convenient way to own gold without storing it yourself. But the problem with these two methods was that in the former, you’d have to take the risk of storing physical gold on your own. And if someone wanted to use ETFs as a way to slowly save up for physical gold in the future, they’d eventually have to sell their ETF units, pay capital gains tax on the profits, and only then buy the gold. Plus, investing wasn’t as simple as firing up an app back then. Getting a demat account to invest in ETFs was another added headache. So you can imagine why that didn’t seem feasible for small investors and why Augmont spotted a gap there. So it introduced the idea of fractional digital gold , letting people buy gold digitally starting from as low as ₹1, while the company stored equivalent physical gold in secure, third-party vaults. It even offered features like buying gold with a small down payment and paying the rest in instalments. And the idea clicked. India has always had an obsession with gold , and if owning it became as easy as tapping a button, people were more than happy to jump in. Soon after, MMTC-PAMP, a joint venture between government-owned MMTC Ltd. and Swiss refiner MKS PAMP, emerged as another major player. It was (and still is) India’s largest gold refiner and eventually became the biggest custodian of digital gold in the country. It then partnered with companies like Motilal Oswal, Paytm, and PhonePe for wider distribution. And for these platforms, the tie-up was a win-win for two big reasons. First, around 2017 , the RBI tightened rules for wallets. If a company wanted to run a wallet like Paytm Wallet, they had to follow strict KYC (Know Your Customer) norms and regulatory requirements. Digital gold, however, didn’t fall under any wallet regulations. And because jewellery purchases below ₹2 lakh didn’t require KYC under PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) rules, apps realised they could let users buy small amounts of digital gold without the paperwork. And once users held that gold balance inside the app, it helped these platforms retain some of the business they were losing from people who didn’t want to open wallets because of the stricter KYC rules. Second, digital gold became a great onboarding tool . Once customers were buying gold on the app, platforms could nudge them into exploring other financial products. That’s how players like HDFC Securities, Upstox, and Groww also began offering digital gold. And that gave digital gold serious momentum. People could invest tiny amounts, set up SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans), and treat it almost like a savings product. By 2021, stockbrokers were estimated to account for 10–12% of the roughly ₹5,000 crore worth of digital gold sold in India annually. And since nearly 85% of customers never requested physical delivery, it created an uncomfortable possibility. If a platform wasn’t maintaining sufficient gold reserves, redemptions could be funded using money from new buyers. Not that digital gold is a Ponzi scheme, but without mandated audits, the risk of such a situation going unnoticed was very real. And you could say that this was the moment regulators finally realised how big the problem had become. But by then, it was too late to step in with fresh rules. Or rather, impossible. No regulator actually had the authority to oversee digital gold in the first place, simply because of how it was classified, as we explained at the start. So SEBI did the only thing it could do. It told its regulated intermediaries — stockbrokers and later even registered investment advisers, to stop offering or recommending digital gold to customers. So in hindsight, you see that digital gold was never officially “allowed”. But no regulator could ban it either. And when something sits in that grey zone, it’s technically legal by default. Platforms capitalised on that ambiguity. It became a bit like those gold purchase schemes your neighbourhood jeweller offers — unregulated, based on trust, and meant for people who plan to buy gold later. If anything goes wrong, all you have is the protection of ordinary company and consumer laws. And that’s exactly how digital gold managed to grow as big as a ₹13,800 crore market today. But now, SEBI has made its concerns clearer. If something goes wrong with digital gold, it has no legal authority to step in and protect investors. So what does that mean for you, you ask? Well, first things first. If you’ve invested in digital gold, don’t panic. Many analysts suggest that investors gradually shift to SEBI regulated gold ETFs or EGRs (Electronic Gold Receipts). EGRs are slightly different from ETFs. In the sense, they’re receipts traded on the stock exchange that represent physical gold stored in a vault, and they can eventually be redeemed for actual gold. They also tend to be more cost-efficient. Because with digital gold, you usually pay a higher price to cover storage, insurance, and platform margins, plus a 3% GST on your purchase. Which means that even if gold prices rise by, say, 2% the next day, you could still end up selling at a loss because of these embedded costs. So yeah, if you already hold digital gold, you could either take delivery, sell and shift the money to regulated options, or simply leave your existing holdings untouched if you trust the platform (at your own discretion and risk) and start any fresh investments through ETFs or EGRs instead. Because a mass panic exit is the quickest way to make a worry turn real. And we definitely don’t want that.

The Story When you wake up in the morning, the first thing you probably do is make yourself a cup of chai (sorry coffee lovers). And that chai is probably made on a stove that lit up because of an LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) cylinder. We’re assuming that because most of India or about 62% of all households, uses LPG as their primary cooking fuel. Now, LPG is composed mainly of two flammable hydrocarbons: propane and butane. And LPG used for cooking in India specifically needs to be more butane heavy. That’s because propane vaporises at very low temperatures, meaning it produces high pressure even in cold climates. That’s great if you live in a country like Canada, but not so much in a tropical country like India, where most regions are warm or hot. A propane-dominant cylinder would build too much pressure in India’s heat. Butane, on the other hand, vaporises at higher temperatures, gives a steady flame, and packs more energy per unit of volume, which is perfect for cooking in a country like ours. But why are we telling you all this? Because this butane-heavy preference is exactly why India is so heavily dependent on the Middle East for LPG. We source about 90% of our imports from there, despite the US being the world’s largest LPG producer. The reason is simple. Middle Eastern LPG mostly comes from oil refineries. And refinery-grade LPG naturally ends up with more butane because of how crude oil breaks down during refining. So Middle Eastern LPG is butane-rich by default. Basically, a byproduct of turning crude into petrol, diesel, and jet fuel. On the flip side, the US produces most of its LPG from natural gas processing, not refining. Natural gas streams contain far more propane than butane, which is why US LPG is propane dominant. Naturally, this doesn’t suit India’s domestic cooking needs. And of course, freight costs from the Middle East to India have always been much lower simply because it’s closer. So the Middle East enjoyed a natural cost and product-fit advantage. But just yesterday, the Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Hardeep Singh Puri, announced India’s first structured, long-term contract to source LPG from the US. Think of it as a formal, predictable supply deal. Specifically, India’s three OMCs — IOCL, BPCL, and HPCL, will purchase 2.2 MTPA (million tonnes per annum) from the US. That’s roughly 10% of India’s annual LPG imports. Before this, India mostly relied on spot market purchases or one-off cargoes negotiated depending on price and availability. Sure, we had recurring Middle Eastern suppliers, but those weren’t fixed long-term structured contracts. But now India has gone ahead and decided to source a significant chunk of its LPG from the US. And you’re probably thinking, “Wait… didn’t Finshots just tell me that US LPG is propane-heavy and way farther away? So why on earth are we buying from them?” Well, you can partly blame or maybe even thank the US–China trade war . You see, China was normally the single largest buyer of US LPG. But when the Trump administration imposed huge tariffs on Chinese goods a few months ago, China retaliated by slowing down LPG imports from the US. Suddenly, US producers were sitting on extra propane-heavy LPG they needed to send somewhere. And the price softened. At the same time, the Iran–Israel conflict and tensions around the Strait of Hormuz pushed Middle Eastern freight costs higher due to war premiums and risk insurance. Since 20% of the world’s oil and LPG passes through Hormuz, any threat of disruption makes shipping more expensive. And for the first time ever, the price of US LPG to India became competitive with Middle Eastern supplies. So India stepped in, bought some discounted US LPG shipments, and then decided to lock in that advantage through a one-year structured contract beginning 2026. The deal comes with some other benefits too. For starters, by reducing Middle Eastern dependence by 10%, India gains some insulation from geopolitical shocks around the Strait of Hormuz. For context, a few months ago, India had backup LPG storage for only about 16 days of consumption. That’s not ideal if you’re trying to keep Indian kitchens running. So in a situation like this, diversifying supply sources strengthens energy security. This diversification also means India now gets to work with two different pricing benchmarks. Think of them as two separate “reference prices” that the world uses to trade LPG. Middle Eastern suppliers follow the Saudi Aramco Contract Price , which is basically the global benchmark for LPG coming out of that region. For years, India has been tied almost entirely to this number. If Aramco’s price went up, India simply had to swallow it. But with US imports in the mix, Indian OMCs can also buy using the Mont Belvieu benchmark, the pricing standard on the US Gulf Coast. And here’s why that matters. When you have two benchmarks instead of one, you suddenly have options, and this gives Indian OMCs some leverage. If Aramco’s prices spike, Mont Belvieu might still be cheaper. And if the US gets too expensive, the Middle East could be the better deal. This competition between suppliers could eventually lead to more favourable pricing across the board. In fact, Middle Eastern suppliers know this and don’t want to lose India — their biggest LPG customer. So they’ve already started lowering prices to stay competitive. And finally, there’s also a diplomatic angle. As you know, the US recently slapped a 50% tariff on some Indian goods because it feels that India sells more to America than it buys and keeps import duties on US goods high. So by picking up more US energy, India is basically trying to balance the trade relationship a little and make future negotiations a bit easier. But there are downsides too. US LPG is still propane-heavy, which isn’t ideal for India’s cooking mix. This means OMCs will need to blend incoming US LPG with butane or adjust infrastructure in some parts of the supply chain. And yes, the US is much farther than the Middle East, so freight will always be costlier. The only reason US supplies became competitive this time is because China reduced imports, temporarily depressing US prices. But if China resumes normal buying, that price advantage may vanish. But the biggest thing is that this cheaper sourcing may not automatically mean cheaper cylinder prices for consumers like us. That’s because the price you pay for a cylinder today isn’t the real price, even if you’ve given up your LPG subsidy. OMCs buy LPG at global benchmark prices, after adding freight, insurance, port charges and everything in between, and then still sell it to you at a standard rate of around ₹853 (in Delhi for a 14.2 kg cylinder). In many cases, their buying price is actually higher than what you pay. And that gap widens even more under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), where OMCs supply subsidised cylinders to women from low-income households at prices that can be roughly ₹300 lower. Put all of this together and OMCs end up with something called under-recovery. Basically, the loss between what it costs them to buy LPG and what they’re allowed to charge you. In FY25, this worked out to about ₹220 per cylinder , adding up to a massive ₹41,270 crore in total under-recoveries for the three PSU OMCs. This did improve by around 35% in Q1 FY26 (April to June 2025), partly after a small ₹50 price hike that the government allowed. But with cheaper US LPG coming in, and Middle Eastern suppliers lowering prices thanks to competition, OMCs could trim these losses by another 37%. Now sure, the government does compensate OMCs for these under-recoveries. But lower under-recoveries simply mean that the government has to set aside less from its budget for this support. And that budget is ultimately funded by, well… taxpayers like you and me. So yeah, if you were hoping this new US deal would directly bring down your LPG cylinder price, that’s not how this plays out. And that’s the long and short of it. Until next time… If this story made the India–US LPG deal easier to understand, do us a favour and share it with your friends, family, colleagues, or even strangers on WhatsApp , LinkedIn , or X .

Now on to today’s story. The Story Meet Masayoshi Son, the CEO of Softbank. For years, he has been preaching a new dawn, one he calls the ‘AI Singularity’, a moment he believes will arrive within the next decade, when artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence. That belief became the driving force behind Softbank’s ‘Vision Fund’, a $100 billion fund that actively seeks out and invests in AI startups, ride-hailing companies, and food delivery businesses. Son’s bold bets have made him one of the richest people in Asia, and turned Softbank into one of Japan’s most influential and profitable companies. Now, when you’re running a multi-billion dollar fund, naturally, your eyes turn to the crown jewel of the AI-boom — Nvidia. And for Masayoshi, it wasn’t just a jewel, it was the keys to the empire. You see, he had invested in Nvidia in 2017, way before the stock rallied to the moon! Back then, GPUs (graphics processors) were still a small corner of the semiconductor market, and AI was just beginning to show some promise. But as the world caught on, Nvidia’s value skyrocketed and SoftBank, unfortunately, exited too early. Even Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, couldn’t resist teasing Son about it at the Tokyo AI Summit in 2024 — joking that they could cry together about it. Because at one point, Softbank was among Nvidia’s largest external shareholders. To be fair, that regret is justified. In the past two years, Nvidia’s valuation tripled, briefly hitting $5 trillion this year. That made it the most valuable semiconductor company in history. Their GPUs are at the heart of the generative AI-revolution, powering everything from OpenAI’s ChatGPT to Anthropic’s Claude. So for the Vision Fund, Nvidia was the perfect validation of Son’s long-running bet on the AI Singularity. And which better stock to hold than Nvidia? Its rise was the proof in the pudding. As Nvidia became the hardware engine behind the AI-software boom, Softbank made billions and in every sense, it became the golden goose of the fund. Which is why what happened next confused the entire world. In its October quarterly filings , SoftBank revealed that it had sold its entire Nvidia stake — roughly $5.8 billion worth, locking in almost a twofold return on its investment. The announcement caught markets off guard and briefly pushed SoftBank’s own shares into the red . After all, why would one of the loudest champions of artificial intelligence cash out of the very stock driving the AI boom? For months, analysts and investors had been whispering about a potential AI bubble , and moves like this only fuelled those debates. The numbers themselves seem almost surreal — valuations in the trillions, profit multiples that defy history, and an industry moving faster than it can keep up with demand. But it feels like they saw the public speculation from the Nvidia sale coming, which is why, in the same filing, Softbank stated its plans on investing the gains back into other AI ventures, with one of them being OpenAI. But the irony in that, is how OpenAI is one of Nvidia’s biggest customers. That’s what has investors scratching their heads: capital and funding that leaves Nvidia somehow finding its way back. Which definitely begs the question: Are we actually seeing an AI growth spurt or is it an echo chamber where every dollar invested circulates among the same few companies? Well, the simple answer is both yes and no. For SoftBank, though, it has always been about the long game. Eight years ago, when Eric Gunderson — then CEO of a little-known mapping startup called Mapbox, met Masayoshi Son , he expected to pitch his company. Instead, Son ended up pitching him on his plan to own a slice of every company touching the AI ecosystem, be it food, transport, finance, or medicine, because all of them were collecting data. And data, he argued, would become the new gold mine. Whoever owns the data owns the intelligence. That’s where OpenAI’s “Stargate” project comes in — a massive next-generation AI data centre initiative reported to involve Oracle and projected by industry leaks, to require investments on the scale of hundreds of billions of dollars. But a moonshot like that needs very deep pockets. And this is where SoftBank re-enters the picture. Flush with a quarterly profit of over $16 billion , it suddenly had the firepower to bankroll what might be the most ambitious infrastructure bet in AI history — and position itself as a primary financial backer. At the centre of this effort sits Masayoshi Son, whose vision of the AI Singularity is expanding beyond algorithms into the physical infrastructure that will power them. What began as a US-centric proposal is already global, with the first European site announced in Norway. Okay, but why do data centres need such astronomical budgets? To answer that, we need to rethink what a “data centre” is. You’re probably picturing rows of towers in an air-conditioned server room, with fans whirring in the background. This is how the internet-era servers are built. But companies like OpenAI, that run large language models, need much more than today’s servers can provide. Think tens of thousands of Nvidia GPUs, all linked together to operate as a single unit. That kind of density demands enormous electricity — measured in gigawatts, equivalent to the power consumption of small cities. For context, with each of the 5 planned data centres, the initial plan of Stargate Project will need 10 gigawatts of power in total, enough to run about 7 million homes. These GPUs also run hot, which means advanced liquid cooling is non-negotiable. That partly explains why Norway was chosen as the first European Stargate centre. Naturally cooler temperatures and of course, a lower cost of electricity doesn’t hurt, does it? There’s another strategic layer here. Back in 2024 , China announced plans to build eight advanced computing hubs as a part of its “Eastern Data, Western Computing” strategy. By setting up data centers in the US and Europe, they’re trying to train and keep the next AI boom within western borders. But out of all these reasons, the most interesting is the future of AI itself — AGI or artificial general intelligence. Both Son and Sam Altman are building data centres that can support workloads no one fully understands yet. In short, they’re future-proofing. And all of this fits neatly into SoftBank’s focus on “Physical AI”. Think robotics, data centres, and the cloud infrastructure that links intelligence with the physical world. So if you connect the dots you’ll see that selling Nvidia didn’t mean abandoning the golden goose. It was funding the farm. This was Masayoshi’s goal with the Vision Fund: Own pieces of the companies that are crucial to the AI-driven future. So yeah, it’s more than a financial pivot In its latest quarterly filing, SoftBank described its new strategy as ‘ Physical AI : connecting intelligence with embodiment through robots, data centres, and cloud systems.’ Of course, the irony that Stargate’s construction will rely heavily on Nvidia’s chips, remains. The very company SoftBank exited will supply the silicon powering its next great ambition. But in the end, it perfectly captures this moment in AI history where the industry is so closely tied that even letting go of a golden goose can feel like feeding it from another hand. Until then….

https://finshots.in/archive/the-cop-hypocrisy-recession-recession-and-more,2025-11-16,Sunny Side Up,"🍳The COP hypocrisy, recession recession and more...","16 November 2025 • Sunny Side Up 🍳The COP hypocrisy, recession recession and more... Hey folks! The Economist made an interesting observation this week. It says that apart from the pandemic slump in 2020, the world hasn’t really had a “normal” recession since the 2008 financial crisis. And even after COVID, the global economy has been growing at roughly 3% a year since 2022. Unemployment is low. Company profits are solid. So it almost feels like we’re living through a “recession recession” or a world where recessions have gone missing. Sounds pretty good, right? Well, The Economist isn’t so sure. It argues that economies sometimes need small recessions, just like the body needs an occasional detox. So yeah, recessions are a bit like detoxes for capitalism. They trigger something economists call “creative destruction”. If you read our recent story on why the Economics Nobel went to Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt , you’ll remember what that means. It’s simply the old making way for the new. When weak or outdated businesses shut down, the people, money and resources tied up in them naturally flow to stronger, more promising companies. And that shift ends up strengthening the whole economy. And interestingly, research shows that startups born during recessions often outperform those launched in boom years. Microsoft, Apple and Uber are all classic examples. Now, some rich countries, especially the US, actually look ready for a mild “detox”. Not because everything is crashing, but because a few things look stretched. The US government’s debt has crossed $38 trillion for the first time ever. Nearly 30% of American household wealth is sitting in stocks, which is a record high. And there’s a massive rush of money into AI companies, some of which may not have the strongest long-term prospects. But modern governments rarely sit back and let recessions run their natural course. They intervene aggressively by supporting households, banks and companies whenever the economy shows signs of wobbling. That prevents downturns, but it also means piling on more public debt. Which makes us wonder — what about India? By the technical definition, India hasn’t had a homegrown recession in roughly 40 years. If we ignore the COVID shock (which hit every country), our last real recession was in 1980. The Iranian Revolution and the Iran–Iraq war pushed global oil prices up, India’s inflation shot to nearly 29% , and GDP shrank by around 5%. But after that, India grew steadily through liberalisation, the IT boom, foreign investment inflows, startup growth, digitisation and finally the payments revolution. Today, India looks relatively stable. Inflation has dropped to a 13 year low of 0.25% recently. Our debt-to-GDP ratio hovers near 81% and is expected to gradually decline. GDP growth is stronger than most big emerging economies. And while market valuations do look stretched, much of that would correct itself naturally if the hype subsided. It’s unlikely to trigger a recession as long as the underlying companies remain fundamentally strong. A bit of selective investing and caution should keep things healthy. Meanwhile, countries that might actually need a “detox” are working overtime to avoid one. For context, rich-world public debt has climbed to levels not seen in more than two centuries because governments keep writing cheques to prevent downturns. And yet, J.P. Morgan says that the probability of a US or global recession in 2025 has fallen from 60% to 40%. So maybe we’re just building up more debt and delaying a deeper crash. Or maybe policymakers will keep kicking the can down the road for a while. Until then, enjoy this strange “recession recession” while it lasts. Here’s a soundtrack to put you in the mood 🎵 Break free by When Chai Met Toast Ready to roll? What caught our eye this week 👀 The COP hypocrisy The 30th annual UN climate change conference ( COP30 ) kicked off in Belém, Brazil this week. And everyone’s focus had been on the traditional questions. Will rich countries step up with climate finance for developing nations? Can fossil-fuel-dependent economies make a real shift? Will Brazil launch a major fund to protect its forests? Until something unexpected caught their attention. The official COP website itself may be a surprisingly huge emitter of carbon. Wait... what? Yup. A recent study by the University of Edinburgh found that the websites built for COP conferences emit up to 10 times more carbon per page-view than the global average webpage. And between the late 1990s and 2024, average emissions from these COP websites jumped by more than 13,000%. For context, the average internet page emits about 0.36 g of CO₂ equivalent per view. But these glossy COP sites now emit more than 2.4 g on average per visit. And in one case, traffic to a COP homepage generated roughly 116.85 kg of CO₂ equivalent — enough to need five to ten mature trees a full year to absorb it. So why is this happening? Well, one big reason is digital design bloat. The COP sites increasingly include high-resolution media, interactive features, complex scripts, all of which drive up energy use and emissions. The study also points out that the COP30 website is not yet verified as being hosted on renewable energy powered infrastructure. Meanwhile, the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) host-country framework doesn’t currently require sustainable digital infrastructure or energy-efficient web design when approving COP websites. Because resources and attention often go to the physical logistics of the conference, such as the venue, accommodation, transportation, and waste management, digital infrastructure can get neglected. But this isn’t just a technical footnote. A few years ago, at COP28 , the host (UAE’s) website’s “low-carbon toggle” button was criticised as greenwashing when investigations found it barely reduced emissions. So yeah, even the websites we visit to track climate action deserve a climate check. Because if the flagship conference of the climate movement can’t match its own digital actions to its ambitions, it basically shows that it has a long way to go on the bigger climate fight.

But here’s a quick sidenote before we begin. The Insurance Masterclass series starts tomorrow. Tomorrow’s session focuses on life insurance - how to choose the right cover and avoid costly gaps.

The Story If someone asked you how economists measure economic growth, your first instinct would probably be to say, “By looking at how much the total value of goods and services has increased over time.” In other words, by tracking how the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has grown. And that’s exactly what one of this year’s Economics Nobel Laureates , Joel Mokyr, was doing. He wanted to understand how economies grew before and after the Industrial Revolution in Europe. But along the way, he stumbled upon something rather odd. When he looked at data from Sweden and Britain between the early 1300s and the early 1700s, he noticed that incomes sometimes went up and sometimes dipped. But overall, there was barely any long-term growth — even with big, disruptive innovations like the invention of the printing press. If you were to plot this on a graph, the line representing economic growth between these years would look almost flat like a long plateau. Source But then, the graph starts to look completely different from the early 19th century — right after the Industrial Revolution gathered steam. From that point on, things changed dramatically. Apart from a few major hiccups, like the Great Depression in the 1930s and a handful of other crises, growth replaced stagnation as the new normal. Economies began expanding steadily, decade after decade, right up to the present day. And this wasn’t just a British or Swedish story. Many industrialised countries followed the same pattern, growing at a consistent pace of around 1.5% a year. Now, that might not sound like a lot on paper, but when you think about it, steady growth at that rate can double a person’s income over their working lifetime. Source And that made Mokyr curious. Why on earth would this difference in growth happen? Turns out, the answer boiled down to three surprisingly simple things. For starters, before the Industrial Revolution, innovation was built on what he called “prescriptive knowledge”. That means people knew how to do something, but not why it worked. Take a blacksmith, for instance. He might’ve known that heating and hammering metal in a certain way made it stronger. But he had no clue about atoms, heat transfer, or any of the science behind it. Then there was “propositional knowledge” — the kind that explains the why and how behind things. And back then, this theoretical knowledge had very little to do with actual invention. Basically, the people who made things weren’t talking to the people who studied why things worked. And because of that separation, innovation was often random or misguided. For example, many were obsessed with building perpetual motion machines or devices that could supposedly run forever without needing any external energy source. But the problem is, the laws of thermodynamics tell us that energy can’t be created from nothing. Every machine loses energy through heat, friction, or resistance. So perpetual motion is physically impossible. And because of this, innovation before the Industrial Revolution often looked like guesswork, where people had their eureka moments purely by accident. That began to change during the 16th and 17th centuries, when Europe went through what we now call the Scientific Revolution — a period that transformed how people thought about the world. It was part of evidence-based thinking that started replacing superstition and blind tradition. Scientists began insisting on new standards for how knowledge should be created. In short, they came up with three basic rules : Don’t just say that something works. Measure it accurately. Test one factor at a time so that you can isolate what’s really causing an effect. And finally, if someone repeats your experiment, they should get the same result. These practices made science more reliable and more connected to practical work. And that’s precisely how the marriage of theory and practice led to bigger, deliberate inventions rather than accidental ones. But just knowing the theory and the practice wasn’t enough. You also needed technical skill and commercial support. Because without those, even the most brilliant ideas would remain just that… ideas on paper. Take Leonardo da Vinci. He lived nearly 300 years before the Industrial Revolution and wasn’t just a painter. He was an inventor, engineer, and scientist too. He sketched out flying machines, parachutes, diving suits, and even an early version of a helicopter which he called the “ aerial screw ”. It looked like a giant linen-and-reed screw that, in theory, could spin upward through the air. But in reality, it couldn’t fly. Source That’s because da Vinci didn’t have the right materials. Wood and canvas were too heavy. His power sources, mostly human hands, weren’t strong enough. And no one understood aerodynamics. So while he and the people of his time were brilliant thinkers, they couldn’t turn imagination into invention. Britain, by contrast, had that perfect mix when the Industrial Revolution rolled in: skilled workers who could read blueprints, engineers who could experiment and improve, and entrepreneurs who could fund production and scale it up. But there was one more ingredient. For growth to last, society had to be open to change, even when that change was uncomfortable. Because you see, every new technology creates winners and losers. For instance, machines replaced manual labourers, computers replaced typewriters, and today, AI is rewriting job roles. The same thing happened back then with the steam engine and mechanised looms. Efficiency rose, but jobs were lost. Naturally, those who lost out resisted. But it wasn’t easy because earlier, during monarchies and feudal systems, a small elite of nobles, landlords, or clergy could easily block any change that threatened their power. But by the time of the Industrial Revolution, though, things were different. Political power had spread. Parliament now included not just aristocrats, but merchants and industrialists too. That made it harder for any one group to hold back progress. And as society began valuing reason and evidence over tradition, change was no longer considered something to fear. That explained why the growth spike happened. But it led to another question. If new inventions constantly replaced old ones, wiping out companies or even entire industries in the process, how did the economy keep growing? That’s where this year’s other two Nobel laureates, Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt, enter the story. They built a model to explain how technological change sustains growth in the modern world. And for that they began with a simple question — in a perfectly free market, would companies invest the right amount in research and development (R&D) to keep the economy growing? This model showed that two opposing forces shape innovation: Too little R&D, where companies know their breakthroughs won’t stay profitable forever and that someone else will invent something better and take their place. That discourages investment. But from society’s point of view, every old idea still adds value because it becomes the foundation for the next one. So, overall, firms tend to underinvest in R&D, which is why governments often step in with support or subsidies. Too much R&D. When one company launches a new product, it can drive another out of business. They call this “business stealing”, similar to creative destruction. Sometimes, the new product is only slightly better, yet it captures big profits. That means too many resources can end up chasing small improvements, making innovation inefficient. And this understanding helped policymakers strike a balance in knowing when to push innovation and when to pace it. It also laid the groundwork for understanding competition. They figured that too few companies or monopolies can stifle innovation. But too many can make profits so thin that firms stop innovating altogether. So the sweet spot was to have enough competition to keep ideas flowing, but not so much that it kills long-term investment. And while we’ve talked about how innovation affects companies, you can’t ignore that it affects people too. That’s why Aghion and Howitt argue that governments shouldn’t protect jobs, but workers — by helping people retrain and move into new roles. They call it flexicurity — a portmanteau (a word made by combining two others) of flexibility for firms and security for workers. But there’s a catch. Sustained growth isn’t the same as sustainable growth. Progress often brings side effects like pollution, climate change, inequality, and resource depletion. And that could mean growth could stall again. But Mokyr believed these very challenges could spark new innovations or that technology could correct itself. But that only happens when guided by smart public policy such as climate action, healthcare, and fair distribution of wealth. Because economic growth isn’t guaranteed. After all, for most of human history, stagnation was the norm. And if we ignore the risks that come with innovation, we could slip back into that pattern. But if we pay attention to the lessons from Mokyr, Aghion, and Howitt — staying open to ideas, encouraging innovation, and managing its side effects wisely, we can keep the engine of progress running for generations to come. And maybe, just maybe, we’ll keep that growth curve from flattening again. Until then… Note: An earlier version of this story mentioned “creative disruption” when we meant “creative destruction”.

And with that out of the way, let’s take a look back at what we wrote this week. The Tata Trusts Saga Explained A little over a year ago, the world mourned the loss of Ratan Tata. While the world was mourning his loss, the empire behind the Tata name was learning to move on without him. Noel Tata took over as chairman of the trusts, and what followed was a boardroom drama of the ages. And because of the size and importance of Tata Trusts umbrella of companies, this seat is one of the most important in Corporate India. While the boardroom drama started over a year ago, another timer was ticking the background: the listing of Tata Trusts. And nobody needed this listing as much as the SP Group, with a looming debt repayment of billions of dollars coming close. Eventually, the boardroom battle caught the government’s attention, and it had to ask the folks at Tata Trusts to settle the dispute, because stability became a national interest. We walk you through the full saga in our Monday story here . The PhysicsWallah IPO Explained Education in India used to be limited to classrooms, dusty chalkboards and tuition centres. The IT boom changed that, and with YouTube, one teacher could teach millions of students. Suddenly the reach was limitless. And on the back of that revolution, was one YouTube channel called Physics Wallah. Built entirely on Alakh Pandey’s blackboard-style teaching, it evolved into a full-fledged edtech brand that today commands one of the most loyal student communities in the country. And now, PhysicsWallah is heading to the public markets. In a country where test prep is a lucrative business worth ₹1 lakh crore, PhysicsWallah chose a different path. It kept courses extremely affordable, expanded into hybrid learning early, and focused primarily on Tier-2 and Tier-3 towns where the demand for test prep is deepest. And the bet paid off, with revenues climbing to over ₹3,000 crores in FY25. Their offline business seems to be working but the risks are looming — from classroom operations to teacher attrition as high as 30%. Can PhysicsWallah maintain the course and capture the test prep industry? Read our Tuesday story here for the full coverage. India wants its own stablecoin? Our relationship with crypto has always been bittersweet. While the government doesn’t necessarily like crypto, it doesn't mind taxing it either. But now, the blockchain giant Polygon is working with Anq, an Indian fintech startup, on what might be India’s first ever stablecoin. Stablecoins already exist for other currencies like the dollar and the fact that they’re pegged to actual fiat currencies or precious metals makes them less volatile, hence the name ‘stablecoins’. But the surprising part of it is how Indians are the biggest holders of these stablecoins, despite not having our own. This dollar denominated stablecoin dominance could lead to us having our own stablecoin, but not without challenges with regulation and uncertainty with adoption. In our Wednesday story, we breakdown what it takes and the road ahead. What SEBI’s new AIF rules mean Mutual funds are the easiest funds to understand. You and a bunch of others pool in money, and no matter how much it is, each of you get a percentage return of your own investment. Alternative Investment Funds or AIFs are a lot different than that. It’s a high stakes table, where the entry bar is high and so are the risks. Which meant that the rules weren’t even across the table, going against what ‘funds’ are actually supposed to do. And that’s why SEBI wanted to change that. But what does ‘change’ mean exactly, when not all AIFs are made the same way? What about existing ‘rules’ (PPMs) for the active schemes? And what does ‘commitment’ actually mean now? These uncertainties led to a difference in what the rules say and what’s practiced in real life. SEBI answered all this and more in its consultation paper on AIF and we broke it down in our Thursday newsletter here . How digital gold became India’s favourite unregulated investment For years now, digital gold has quietly become one of India’s favourite ways to buy the shiny yellow metal. The convenience made it irresistible — open an app, start with as little as ₹1, and you suddenly feel like you’ve taken your first step toward owning gold. But last week, SEBI reminded everyone of something crucial. Digital gold isn’t regulated. Which means you have no guaranteed way of knowing whether the gold you’ve “bought” can actually be redeemed for physical gold. No regulator — neither SEBI nor the RBI, oversees it. No one verifies how much gold these companies truly hold. And you can imagine the chaos if everyone tried redeeming their digital balances at once. So why wasn’t digital gold regulated all this while? And if it wasn’t, how did it still end up becoming such a huge investment product that so many Indians love? Find out in our Friday story here !

Students, this is your chance to bag ₹2.25 lakh in cash, pre-placement interviews, cool goodies, and serious bragging rights. Click here to apply . You don’t want to miss this! Now, on to today’s story. The Story It begins in Surat, in a small office, where dozens of traders logged in every morning, convinced they were part of something big. They believed they were trading through a reputable broker terminal, getting special limits that normal retail traders could never access, and using a setup that looked institutional and efficient. For months, it worked like a charm. Until one random morning, the terminals simply stopped responding. And to know the workings behind how this came to be, let’s take it from the top. You see, this office, according to Moneycontrol’s reporting , belonged to a firm called Green Wall Enterprises. If you walked past it, you’d see Jainam Stock Broking’s boards everywhere. Everyone casually called it “the Jainam branch”. And nobody even questioned it. Because, well, who goes around checking if a board on the wall is fake? Except it was, and Jainam later clarified that they had absolutely nothing to do with Green Wall. But here’s where things start to get interesting. Behind Green Wall was a man, Darshan Joshi, known as DJ. DJ wasn’t a SEBI-registered stockbroker himself. Instead, he ran a Greater Noida–based firm called iTrade Associates that was closely linked to Green Wall. And he handled crores of rupees that traders sent him from Delhi NCR, Jaipur, Ranchi, Kolhapur, wherever. So he was basically operating as an agent for Green Wall. And people trusted him because he gave them something magical: crazy leverage. The kind where a ₹1 crore deposit turns into over ₹7 crore of trading firepower in the F&O (futures and options) markets. But before we go further, let’s take a step back to understand how prop trading actually works. In markets, this high-power betting usually happens through something called a proprietary trading desk, or a “prop desk”. It’s basically a special account that brokers use to trade their own money. Their money, their risk. It’s meant only for them, not for outsiders. And because it’s house money, brokers typically have more flexibility internally in terms of how much risk they want to take, how big the positions can be, and how fast they can move. This isn’t the kind of freedom a retail trader gets. So the key point is that prop trading is strictly meant for a broker using its own capital, for its own benefit — not for outsiders looking to borrow leverage. But that’s exactly what was happening at Green Wall Enterprises. Some brokers found a way to quietly let outsiders trade through these prop accounts (something that is strictly prohibited) and earn from it on the side. And traders realised they could get monster leverage without the usual rules or paperwork. That way, both sides benefitted, and so, nobody asked too many questions. And that’s what led to a perfect little black-market trading system. For instance, a trader would hand over ₹20–50 lakh to an agent like DJ. DJ would take the money to Green Wall, where the broker effectively gave the trader access to the broker’s prop trading limits, even though the trades were made in the broker’s name. In return, the broker earned interest, brokerage, and sometimes a profit share. DJ pocketed a commission. And the trader got massive leverage and freedom to trade without formal checks. All this happened without any KYCs , contracts or client codes… at least not in the way a regular retail account would have them. But it didn’t matter, because profits kept coming in. Until, in August, the key individuals behind Green Wall — Nimit Shah and Hiren Jadav, simply vanished. Terminals froze mid-trade and positions could not be squared off. And suddenly everyone realised the horrible truth: their money wasn’t in the official broking system to begin with. It was floating in informal channels or dummy trading accounts or private bank accounts, controlled by people who were no longer picking up calls. DJ claimed he was a victim too. Losses were first estimated at ₹5 crore… then ₹22 crore… then ₹40 crore… and eventually industry insiders said the number might be closer to ₹150 crore. And the deeper investigators went, the uglier things looked. Green Wall’s collapse brought to light a wider ecosystem . In many of these prop-trading setups, brokers like Green Wall were showing outside traders as ‘employees’ on paper, issuing salary slips so they appeared as in-house staff during inspections. Thousands of fake NISM certificates were being floated around so traders could get ‘approved user’ IDs on prop terminals. Many traders genuinely believed this was a legit setup, and didn’t know they were breaking rules simply by logging in. In these arrangements, losses could be shifted onto such ‘employee accounts’, deposits withheld, and profit and loss updates sent through unofficial emails. Moneycontrol even detailed a similar case in Mumbai, where traders lost around ₹1 crore and were allegedly threatened when they showed up to ask for refunds. And the worst part is that none of this technically appears in SEBI’s famous statistic that 91% of F&O traders lost money in FY25, because these trades didn’t originate from real client accounts in the first place. They happened outside the system, in the shadows. So, what’s next, you ask? For now, market regulator SEBI has stepped in and asked exchanges to investigate the misuse of prop-trading accounts, including who was actually sitting behind such terminals and how access in Surat got extended to traders in places like Delhi, Jodhpur and Kolhapur. The regulator is also pushing for tighter rules such as mandatory mapping of MAC (Media Access Control) and IP addresses, so investigators can precisely identify where trades were placed. Separately, its probe is expected to look at issues like fake certificates and roundabout money flows between brokers and related entities. But the real question is how did so many people walk straight into this mess? How did something this obviously risky, this obviously informal, this obviously too-good-to-be-true feel normal to so many traders across so many cities? And a big part of the answer lies in simple human psychology. You see, markets amplify hope and fear. And above all, they amplify the belief that somewhere out there, someone is playing the game better than you. So when an agent whispers, “This is how the big traders operate”, it doesn’t feel like a warning but a secret. It feels like you’ve been handed an insider pass to a smarter, faster, more powerful way of making money. And once that feeling kicks in, the brain quietly switches off all the alarms. And that’s the thing about shortcuts. They don’t announce themselves as shortcuts. They arrive disguised as opportunities: special limits, exclusive access, low margins, high confidence. They work beautifully, right up until the moment they don’t. And by the time you realise you were balancing on a thread, the thread has already snapped. Most traders caught in this saga weren’t reckless gamblers. They were hopeful of better than normal returns too quickly. They saw people around them making money. And they assumed that if so many people were doing it, it had to be legitimate. It felt like they had discovered a clever trick that the rest of the world hadn’t figured out yet. But as Warren Buffett loves to remind the world, there are no free lunches, especially in markets, where every extra ounce of return has a matching ounce of risk hiding in the shadows. And that’s exactly where this whole saga lands. Because the real danger wasn’t just the fake terminals or the shady intermediaries. It was the illusion and the belief that traders were getting something the system wouldn’t normally give. Once that illusion felt real, everything else looked normal. It’s a reminder that if your name isn’t on the trading account, if your money isn’t inside the regulated system, if the paperwork doesn’t exist, if the limits look magical, and if everything relies on “just trust me”, then you’re not trading. You’re sitting in a backroom casino. So the next time anyone promises you such things, you know what to do. Run away as fast as you can, and don’t stop to negotiate!

But here’s a quick sidenote before we begin. Finshots Idea Lab is back with season 2!

Click here to know more about the competition and apply. Now, on to today’s story. The Story Mutual funds are easy to understand today. You pool your money with thousands of other investors into a themed fund — maybe focused on an industry or an asset class. And whether you invest ₹500 or ₹50,000, you earn returns in the same proportion. Everyone plays by the same rules, and everyone gets a fair deal. But what if you’re an investor with crores lying idle, looking for something high-risk and high-reward? Then you start looking beyond your typical assets like bonds, equities, or real estate. The basic mutual funds don't impress you. And that’s where Alternative Investment Funds, or AIFs, come in. Here, the entry bar is high, and fund managers operate by a different rulebook. You’re not buying listed shares or government securities anymore. It’s more like betting on startups, private companies, hedge strategies, or even exotic assets like art. Because of this exclusivity, the rules in AIFs have always been... flexible. A ₹500 crore AIF could raise money from just a handful of investors, and some of them could negotiate special terms like early payouts or priority exits. Essentially, the bigger the cheque, the better the deal. And that didn’t sit well with SEBI. So the regulator decided to step in. Back in December 2024 , SEBI released a circular that said all investors in an AIF must have fair and equal rights when it comes to their undrawn commitments. And that fairness rested on two terms: pro-rata and pari-passu. What does that mean? Well, imagine you and your friend renting a house. You stay for 10 days, and your friend stays for 20. Now, if you divide the rent based on how long each of you stayed in, i.e. a 10:20 ratio, that’s pro-rata or paying in proportion to your share. Now imagine that even though you stayed for 10 days and your friend stayed for 20, you both still pay the same rent, under the same agreement, and on the same day. That’s pari-passu , which is also known as equal footing or equal treatment. The reason these two terms made it to the 2024 circular is because the regulator noticed that in some AIFs, equal treatment wasn’t seen across all investors. That meant two people in the same fund, investing in the same deal, could walk away with very different results. It went against the spirit of a pooled fund, where everyone’s money is supposed to share the same risk and reward. But enforcing fairness in complex funds like AIFs is easier said than done. That’s because, unlike mutual funds where all the money is invested upfront, AIFs don’t take your entire investment on day one. Fund managers call for capital in stages. Even then, it's only when they find a company or project worth investing in. The rest stays with the investor until it’s needed. Say you commit ₹10 crore to an AIF. The manager might draw ₹6 crore immediately and call the remaining ₹4 crore later. That ₹4 crore is your “undrawn commitment” or money you’ve promised but not yet deployed. It’s still part of the total amount you’ve committed, but it’s just not invested yet. And this is where confusion began. Did SEBI’s fairness rule apply to the total commitment or only the undrawn part? How should existing schemes transition to the new system? Could fund managers stick to old agreements signed through Private Placement Memorandums (PPMs)? Sidebar: Private Placement Memorandums are legal documents that are used for private securities. It tells potential investors about the risks, terms and opportunities of the investment. All these uncertainties led to a difference in what the rules say and what’s practiced in real life. And it meant that fund managers were caught between breaching old contracts or violating the regulator’s circular. Even the word ‘commitment’ didn’t necessarily have a clear meaning. Is it the total amount that an investor promised to the fund, or only the undrawn amount? Depending on which it is, an investor’s profit or loss could look very different. Then came in structural confusion, particularly with close-ended schemes. You see, close-ended AIFs raise money and have it invested in levels or tranches so the rules seem pretty straightforward. But what if it’s an open-ended fund? Capital flows in and out every day, so following something like pro-rata becomes tricky. But remember, at its core, though, SEBI’s goal was simple: fairness and protection. When some investors get preferential rights or early exits, it distorts the level playing field of pooled funds. Because of all this, fund managers were left scratching their heads and thinking: can these issues be fixed without reopening old contracts? Nobody knew for sure. That was until last week, when SEBI came out with a consultation paper on the new rules for AIFs. And where better to start, than defining what ‘commitment’ actually means. For close-ended AIFs, the regulator says that funds may calculate pro-rata rights either on the basis of an investor’s total commitment or on the undrawn commitment. But whichever method the fund chooses to follow, it must be clearly stated in the PPM and it can’t be changed later during the lifetime of the scheme. That takes out two birds in one stone: investors know the rules from the ground up, and fund managers don’t have to sway in confusion. Next comes what funds can do with the undrawn commitment, which is basically idle funds. It clearly states that they cannot have it deployed elsewhere secretly. It keeps things fair, transparent and maintains the pro-rata rule. And for funds already operating under old PPMs, there’s a transition phase. As long as they follow one of the approved drawdown methods and disclose it clearly, they won’t have to reopen contracts. Now despite these rules, not all AIFs function the same way, and SEBI knows that. So open-ended category III funds, the type where anyone can enter and exit whenever they want, don’t have to follow the same rules as close-ended funds. So, SEBI says they don’t need to apply the pro-rata rule to drawdowns. Instead, they just need to make sure that profits are shared in proportion to the units each investor holds. SEBI also made it clear that the new fairness rules won’t mess with how fund managers get paid. The profit share that managers or sponsors earn is called carried interest . But it is a reward for performance, not part of the investor pool. So it doesn’t fall under the pro-rata or pari-passu rule. This means managers can still earn their usual performance fees without breaking any regulations. And lastly, SEBI also wants funds to keep better records. This means log every investor’s commitment in rupees, show clearly how pro-rata rights are applied, and make sure trustees verify it in their reports. Past deals (before December 2024) can stay as they are, but every new investment from here on must follow the updated pro-rata rules. For now this is still a draft paper, open to public comment. But if it becomes regulation, India’s AIF ecosystem could finally strike the right balance between fairness and flexibility. Because in a market where big risks often chase big rewards, maybe fairness is the safest bet of them all, no?

Limited seats only. 👉🏽 Click here to register while seats last . Now, on to today’s story. The Story India and the crypto world are like frenemies. The government, the central bank, and the regulators have made it pretty clear that they’re not exactly crypto’s biggest fans. Yet, they don’t want to see the space spiral out of control either. So, they keep it on a tight leash with hefty taxes and strict rules. But in a sudden plot twist, Polygon, one of the biggest names in the blockchain world and Anq, a homegrown fintech startup, have joined hands to build what could be India’s very own stablecoin. They’re calling it, the Asset Reserve Certificate (ARC) , at least for now. That naturally makes you ask, if Indian regulators have always kept crypto at arm’s length, why this sudden warmth toward something like a stablecoin? Well, first things first, India’s relationship with the cryptoverse is something it might not want to build but is forced to, given everything happening in this space. And stablecoins are one such relationship. To understand why, you’ll first need a quick refresher on what stablecoins are. But if you already know what they are and don’t need this, you can skip the italicised bits and jump to the paragraph after it. So imagine now that you’re really eager to invest in a cryptocurrency. Let’s just assume it’s Bitcoin. Bitcoin is basically a decentralised digital currency, meaning no regulator or government controls it. It’s a limited pool of digital coins that need to be “mined” by miners who solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate and record transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. If that sounded complicated, you can understand it in depth in a series we did here , or just think of it this way. Bitcoin isn’t just a currency, it’s a network that allows people to transfer value securely without relying on a bank or government. However, Bitcoin prices are highly volatile because they depend purely on market demand and speculation. It can surge today and crash tomorrow, which means if you use Bitcoin for everyday transactions like buying groceries, a kilo of potatoes could cost ₹30 today, ₹300 tomorrow, and ₹20 the next. That’s impractical. And that’s exactly why the crypto world came up with something else — stablecoins! These are digital tokens that keep all the benefits of crypto (like fast, cost-effective transfers and blockchain-based transparency) but are far more stable in value. Stablecoins get their value by tying, or “pegging”, themselves to something steady like a government currency (say the rupee or US dollar) or even a commodity like gold. Take USDT (Tether) , for instance. One USDT is meant to always equal one US dollar. It works on the simple premise that for every 1 USDT issued, the company behind it (Tether) keeps $1 in reserve, either in cash or in safe assets like US Treasury bills. So, if you give them $100, you get 100 USDT. Return those 100 USDT, and you get $100 back. That’s how the price stays stable, because it’s backed by real money. It’s also a great way to transfer money across borders without a traditional intermediary like a bank. It’s faster and cheaper. That’s why a growing share of remittances from Indians working abroad, as well as Indian traders operating overseas, are now moving to stablecoins. But here’s the thing. The global stablecoin market is worth about $250 billion , and over 98% of it is dollar-based! Two coins, USDT and USDC (issued by Circle), dominate this space, simply because the US dollar is the world’s preferred reserve currency, and these coins are backed by US government securities, which are among the safest assets out there. But again, over 80% of stablecoin transactions happen outside the US, and a big chunk of that comes from… wait for it… India. Yup! Unofficial estimates say that India has over 314 million stablecoin users , the most in the world. Plus, nearly 60% of Indians’ foreign exchange conversions are now into stablecoins. And that’s not just because they’re cheap, but also because of something we didn’t tell you earlier — the sweet lure of arbitrage. See, despite being pegged to something like the dollar, stablecoins are freely tradable on crypto exchanges. Their price can move slightly based on market demand and supply, but not by much, because remember, they’re backed by real assets. The stability also comes from what happens when the value of one stablecoin goes above $1, say, $1.05. That means people are paying too much for it. So traders step in and think, “Wait, I can make a profit here.” They buy new stablecoins directly from the issuing company at $1, then sell them on exchanges for $1.05. That way, they make five cents per coin. And when more traders do this, supply increases and the price naturally falls back to $1. Now, because of these trade mechanics, USDT normally trades at a 4–5% premium in India. It’s simply because Indian rules make it tricky to directly deposit or withdraw rupees from crypto exchanges through banks. Which means, less USDT comes into India through legal channels. So, when a lot of people want to buy USDT but only a small supply is available, prices go up. And, during this time, when you want to send money home from abroad, if $1 = ₹88 officially, USDT might sell for ₹91–₹92 here, which means the folks back in India receive more rupees. This is one reason people love using stablecoins. But since, as we said, most of them are dollar-backed, it means the money essentially flows out of India and strengthens the dollar system more than the rupee system. And that’s exactly what Polygon and Anq want to change. Their plan is to keep the value tied to India’s own government-backed assets, specifically government securities and Treasury bills (T-bills). That way, they hit two birds with one stone. Indian money stays within the country, boosting liquidity and strengthening India’s government securities market. But that’s not the only reason behind the move. Across Asia, countries are building their own currency-backed stablecoins. Just recently, Japan launched a pilot for yen-backed stablecoins to reduce its dependence on dollar-based ones. India probably feels the need to do the same because staying on the sidelines could mean falling behind. Still, there’s a catch. Dollar-backed stablecoins have already earned a reputation for being safer and easier to trade. So, even if India rolls out its own version, how quickly demand will pick up is anyone’s guess. Then there’s still the regulatory grey area around digital assets. If India greenlights stablecoins, private companies might start issuing their own versions, creating parallel payment systems outside traditional banking rails. This has been tried before, but most of those efforts and stablecoin projects fizzled out due to a lack of clear reserve backing, uncertain redemption guarantees, and, more importantly, the absence of a defined regulatory framework. But if these guardrails eventually come into place and stablecoins gain wider adoption, there’s a risk they could start challenging the government’s control over the monetary system and financial stability. In fact, China faced something similar recently. Regulators there stopped firms like Ant Group and JD.com from launching stablecoins, even after passing a new law to regulate them. India could take a cue from that. Before unlocking the full potential of ARC or any rupee-backed stablecoin, it’ll need clear rules around the broader crypto ecosystem. Because without that, the promise of innovation may just hit a policy roadblock. Feels like we’re stuck in some kind of loop now, eh?

But before we begin, here's a quick announcement: Finshots Idea Lab is back!

Compete in 3 rounds to solve real-world business problems and receive cash prizes worth ₹2.25 Lakh, Pre-Placement Interviews, exclusive goodies and a lot more! Know more about the competition and click here to apply ! Now on to today’s story... The Story When we talk about revolutions in Indian education, we often point to the 1990s… liberalisation, private universities, and the IT boom. But the real transformation came later, quietly, through the lens of a camera. Teachers who once filled cramped classrooms suddenly had an infinite audience. Lessons that cost ₹50,000 were now free on YouTube. And in this world a small YouTube channel called PhysicsWallah quietly changed the rules. Because what was started by a young physics tutor named Alakh Pandey, is now a unicorn. It’s a ₹2,800-crore-revenue company, backed by marquee investors, running thousands of classrooms, and now, it’s gearing up for a ₹3,480 crore IPO this week . But to understand PhysicsWallah, we need to zoom out to the business of education itself. India’s education market, worth roughly ₹15 lakh crore, isn’t a single monolith. It’s a collection of overlapping ecosystems. The biggest piece is K–12 schooling where over 25-28 crore children enrol every year and spend their early years. Then comes higher education with 1,000-plus universities and over 45,000 colleges. And beyond that lies the “shadow system” i.e. test preparation, which exists parallel to the formal structure but is arguably more influential. It’s where millions of aspirants prepare for IITs, medical exams, UPSC, banking, and other competitive or government job exams. And increasingly, there’s a fourth segment — upskilling, with short courses and certifications for professionals chasing better opportunities. Source Of these, test prep has become the most commercially explosive. It’s estimated to be a ₹1 lakh crore market, growing at a double-digit pace. Until a few years ago, it was highly fragmented from small local coaching centres, a handful of brand-name hubs, and word-of-mouth reputations built around star teachers. But edtech startups changed that dynamic. They saw an opportunity to standardise quality, scale content, and use technology to make one great teacher accessible to millions. And that’s exactly the thesis on which PhysicsWallah was built. You see, the story began in Allahabad (now Prayagraj) around 2016. Pandey, who’d dropped out of an engineering college, started teaching physics to small batches of students. Then he began uploading his lectures on YouTube which were free, simple, and in Hinglish, for students who couldn’t afford expensive coaching. And his teaching struck a chord. Within months, those videos were racking up millions of views. So by 2020, PhysicsWallah launched its own app and website, turning into a structured edtech business. And it now had courses beyond physics from chemistry and maths to biology with a growing community that trusted the brand. But what made it stand out was affordability. While Byju’s sold packages costing tens of thousands, PhysicsWallah’s courses were often priced under ₹1,000! The idea was to democratise access, not maximise margin. And that positioning of mass-market, low-cost, credible teachers built extraordinary goodwill. As the pandemic turbocharged online learning, it became a national phenomenon. And by 2022, it raised $100 million from investors like WestBridge and GSV Ventures, joining the unicorn club with a valuation of $1.1 billion! But the founders knew the online boom wouldn’t last forever. Once physical classrooms reopened, students wanted face-to-face learning again. And that’s when PhysicsWallah pivoted fast. It expanded into offline centres and built what it now calls a “hybrid ecosystem”. The company’s strategy became simple: attract students online through its free content, then convert them into paying users in offline or hybrid classrooms. That’s why about 95% of its 46 million students first engage online, and around 70% of those who join offline centres are repeat users from the app or YouTube. It’s a funnel that turns attention into enrolment at minimal marketing cost. And this offline push has been aggressive. How aggressive, you ask? Well, PhysicsWallah launched “Vidyapeeth” centres — large-format coaching hubs in metros and tier-1 cities, and “Paathshaala” centres in smaller towns. Today, it has about 198 centres across 109 cities. It’s also been busy acquiring regional players to localise its reach: OnlyIAS for civil services prep, Xylem Learning in Kerala to capture southern markets, and Utkarsh Classes in Rajasthan to tap into vernacular content. In short, PhysicsWallah is doing to coaching what national restaurant chains did to regional eateries: consolidating a scattered market through scale, standardisation, and brand trust. Financially, the strategy has paid off in growth. In FY23, the company reported ₹772 crore in revenue. By FY25, it had crossed that to ₹3,039 crore. That’s a two-year compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of roughly 100%. The offline business has been the key driver, shooting up from ₹281 crore to ₹1,352 crore during that period. Online still provides massive reach with millions of students paying smaller fees, but offline centres bring higher average revenue per user (ARPU) and better monetisation. However, the same shift that drives growth also drives costs. Because see, running classrooms isn’t cheap. You need to figure out teacher salaries, rent, and operating costs which can pile up quickly. PhysicsWallah’s employee expenses alone rose 21% to ₹1,401 crore in FY25, while marketing and publicity costs jumped 41% to ₹276 crore. So despite its reputation for thrift, this is a business where human capital is the real product. Teachers account for over half of total costs, and teacher churn is an existential risk. The company sees 25–30% attrition each year, and some of its top JEE and GATE faculty have left to launch rivals. Yet, PhysicsWallah has managed to stay relatively disciplined. Losses, which ballooned to ₹1,131 crore in FY24 (largely due to goodwill write-offs and one-off non-cash accounting charges), narrowed sharply to ₹243 crore in FY25. And on a normalised basis, the core business is inching toward breakeven. For context, Byju’s was losing roughly ₹4,500 crore a year at a similar scale of revenue. PhysicsWallah’s relatively lean cost structure, partly because of its strong organic marketing, gives it a fighting chance at profitability. So we could see the IPO as a test of whether investors buy that story. Of the ₹3,480 crore the company plans to raise, ₹3,100 crore will come from a fresh issue and ₹380 crore from an offer for sale (OFS), under which founders Alakh Pandey and Prateek Maheshwari will each sell shares, while institutional investors like WestBridge, Lightspeed, and GSV are staying put. That’s a good signal as it shows that long-term capital isn’t rushing for the exit. And where will the fresh funds be used? Mainly to fuel offline growth. About ₹460 crore will go into opening new centres, ₹548 crore for leasing and facility costs, ₹710 crore for marketing initiatives, and ₹200 crore to upgrade technology infrastructure. And a smaller portion, roughly ₹48 crore, will be invested into subsidiaries like Xylem and Utkarsh for lease related payments. Which brings us to the valuations of this IPO. At the upper end of the ₹109 price band, the company would be valued at around ₹31,000 crore — about 10 times its revenue. For comparison, listed education firms like Veranda Learning trade around 4x revenue, while older coaching players like Career Point trade below 2x. But PhysicsWallah’s valuation reflects its scale, brand, and hybrid model. Plus, it has a 10 crore-strong digital community that few peers can match. Nevertheless, the valuations might seem high for a brand that is still struggling to see profitability. And there are other risks as well. For one, expansion is capital-hungry. Each new centre takes nearly two years to break even, and scaling too fast could stretch management bandwidth. Second, the test-prep market itself is cyclical and sensitive to regulation. Any policy changes in major exams like NEET or JEE can alter demand overnight. Third, this is a teacher-driven business. If high-profile educators leave, students often follow. And as rivals like Unacademy and Aakash (now part of Byju’s) fight to regain ground, retaining faculty will remain a constant battle. But despite these risks, the opportunity is enormous. India’s test-prep industry is still only partly organised. Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, where incomes are rising and aspirations are exploding, are PhysicsWallah’s strongest hunting ground. With its low-cost pricing, strong community engagement, and expanding offline footprint, it has a real shot at dominating this middle-market segment. The timing is symbolic too. Just three years ago, edtech was the darling of venture capital and today, it’s viewed with deep suspicion. Byju’s is mired in lawsuits , Unacademy has shrunk dramatically, and investors have largely written off the sector. So if PhysicsWallah keeps ticking the right boxes, and starts delivering even modest profits, it could restore some credibility to India’s education startups. In that sense, this IPO isn’t just a financial event but a referendum on the entire edtech model. Can education be scaled responsibly without losing its soul? Can an enterprise built on free YouTube lectures sustain itself under public scrutiny? And can a teacher-turned-entrepreneur from Allahabad convince Dalal Street that education, done right, can be both meaningful and profitable? These are the questions investors need to ask themselves. PhysicsWallah has already passed the hardest exam of capturing the imagination of millions of Indian students. Now, it faces a new test of winning over investors. And this time, the report card won’t be written on a blackboard.

Now on to today’s story. The Story A little over a year ago, India lost a titan who changed what power could look like – Ratan Tata. When he passed away on October 9th, 2024, the country mourned as if we’d lost that one teacher who quietly kept us going. But that grief came with a strange mix of nostalgia and uncertainty. Because while the world was still remembering the man, the Tata empire was learning how to move forward without him. And that’s where the story begins, inside the boardroom of Tata Trusts, where unity and legacy were about to face their toughest test yet. Two days after Ratan Tata’s passing, the board would make his half-brother, Noel Tata, the new chairman of Tata Trusts, making him one of the most powerful heads of the Tata Empire. What makes this seat so special, you ask? To understand that, you need to know the hierarchy. Picture the Tata ecosystem and you might see cars on roads, Titan watches in stores, Westside or Zudio outlets, maybe even your morning Starbucks cup that says “ A Tata Alliance .” All these companies and more ultimately roll up to Tata Sons , the holding company of the multi-billion dollar conglomerate. And sitting even above that, quietly controlling the empire, is Tata Trusts. So when Noel Tata took charge, it wasn’t just another corporate transition but a shift at the top of the pyramid. And soon after the appointment, the Trusts held its first board meeting without Ratan Tata, and it would be the firestarter of the saga. On paper, it was just another session at Bombay House. But this one carried a different air since the patriarch’s chair was empty, and every decision now had to be made without his quiet nod of approval. And among the resolutions discussed, one stood out. The board decided that when a trustee’s tenure expires and they’re reappointed, it would now be for life . And here’s where things got tricky. If any board member opposed another trustee’s reappointment, they’d be considered ‘unfit’ to sit on the board – effectively forcing everyone to agree, or risk losing their own seat. Even more interestingly, if there was disagreement on reappointment, all decisions made in that meeting could be called into question. Simply put, they either agreed on everything, or nothing at all. This was a power move if there ever was one, because it effectively meant that trustees couldn’t selectively agree to some decisions and disregard the others later. A rule designed to preserve unity had, perhaps unintentionally, tightened control. And while the boardroom appeared calm on the surface, a silent countdown had already begun elsewhere – The Tata Sons listing ! The Reserve Bank of India had set a firm deadline: September 30th, 2025. Back in 2022, the RBI had classified Tata Sons as an “Upper Layer NBFC”, which meant it needed to list within three years. And probably nobody had as much to gain from the listing as the Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) Group – the 2nd largest shareholder in Tata Sons, owning about 18%. That stake alone was worth nearly ₹3 lakh crore! From the 1930s, the SP Group had been the quiet partner in the Tata legacy, helping build homes, bridges, and landmarks across India. But by 2025, its own empire was saddled with over ₹55,000 crore in debt and staring at a $1.2 billion repayment due in December. Liquidity had become the difference between survival and collapse. And the listing of Tata Sons could’ve been their lifeline to unlock the massive value of their holding. They had already sold the Gopalpur port for about ₹2,000 crores and issued a $3.25 billion bond with an eye-watering 19.75% yield rate to stay afloat. But as the September 30th deadline for IPO approached, the much-anticipated listing never came. No merchant bankers were hired, no prospectus was filed. Instead, Tata Sons quietly wrote to the RBI, requesting a review of its “Upper Layer NBFC” classification – essentially seeking to avoid the listing. Because for Tata Trusts, this was about protection. You see, the Trusts depend on dividends from Tata Sons to fund charitable work. And a public listing would expose them to market volatility and stricter regulations. Risks that could limit their autonomy and philanthropy. But internal tensions were starting to bubble. A bloc of four trustees within Tata Trusts — Mehli Mistry, Pramit Jhaveri, Darius Khambata, and Jehangir H.C. Jehangir – opposed the re-appointment of Vijay Singh as the Trusts’ nominee to the Tata Sons board. The reasons cited for this weren’t fully clear, although multiple sources point to a growing power struggle over senior roles. Vijay Singh wasn’t just another trustee. He was a defense secretary and a close confidante of the late Ratan Tata. And his unexpected removal was the first sign of a fracture. (Vijay Singh eventually resigned from the Tata Sons board but remained a trustee.) Now a power vacuum rarely stays empty for long, and soon after, there was an attempt to propose Mehli Mistry’s induction to the Tata Sons board. Except this time, Noel Tata and Venu Srinivasan pushed back and blocked it. So the same bloc that had once resisted Vijay Singh’s reappointment now found itself on the opposite side of Noel Tata’s leadership. By mid-2025, the board had split into two clear camps — Noel Tata, Venu Srinivasan, and Vijay Singh on one side… and Mehli Mistry, Darius Khambata, Pramit Jhaveri, and Jehangir Jehangir on the other. For the first time since Ratan Tata’s era, the Trusts looked divided. The breaking point came in September 2025. Mehli Mistry, who was the executor of Ratan Tata’s will, proposed his own nomination to the Tata Sons board. This move was seen by Noel’s side as self-serving, especially amid an already tense governance debate. And when the vote was called, the board was split 3-3 (three in favor, three against). And Noel, as chairman, cast the deciding vote against Mistry. Days later, when Mistry’s three-year term came up for renewal, the vote again tied 3-3. Once again, Noel’s vote decided the outcome – Mehli Mistry was out. Of course, that exit wasn’t without flair and drama. Within a week, Mistry filed a legal caveat, signaling a possible court challenge. His exit sent ripples through the group, not just because of who he was, but because of what he represented: it symbolised the fading of Ratan Tata’s old guard. Around the same time, the SP Group publicly renewed its call for the Tata Sons listing, urging “transparency and governance accountability.” For the government, this wasn’t just another corporate dispute anymore but more of a confidence issue for the Indian economy. Because the Tata Group isn’t just another business house. It’s one of the oldest, largest and reputed conglomerates in the world. And at a time when foreign investors are pulling out of Indian markets left and right, Bombay House couldn’t appear divided. So in early October, Noel Tata, Venu Srinivasan, and Darius Khambata were summoned to Delhi for a closed-door meeting with Home Minister Amit Shah and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. The message was clear: the country couldn’t afford uncertainty at the top of one of its most trusted business institutions. Stability was now a national interest. When the delegation returned to Mumbai, the mood had shifted. Within weeks, Mehli Mistry withdrew his legal caveat. On November 4, he formally resigned from Tata Trusts, writing that he “did not wish to be a source of discord.” His letter closed with a line Ratan Tata often repeated: “Nobody is bigger than the institution it serves.” Source: X It was a poetic exit, but one that marked the end of an era. The board was back under Noel Tata’s control, but the cost of that control was unmistakable. The Trusts had survived the crisis, but for the first time, they no longer looked unbreakable. And after a year, the real test begins now. Keeping the house united and the trust unshaken.

https://finshots.in/archive/quake-resistant-real-estate-xania-monet-and-more,2025-11-09,Sunny Side Up,"🍳Quake resistant real estate, Xania Monet and more...","9 November 2025 • Sunny Side Up 🍳Quake resistant real estate, Xania Monet and more... Hey folks! Xania Monet just became Billboard’s latest sensation , with a No. 1 R&B hit, over 44 million streams, 1,46,000 Instagram followers, and a multimillion-dollar record deal. Sidebar: Billboard is a company that tracks music popularity, and R&B stands for Rhythm and Blues, a genre that blends blues, jazz, and gospel music. All this, without ever stepping into a studio. Because Xania Monet isn’t real. She’s an AI-generated artist. Her vocals are created by Suno, an AI music platform that turns a few typed prompts into a full-blown R&B track. Now, many singers and record labels aren’t exactly cheering. They’ve accused AI acts like Xania of building success on copyrighted material used to train these tools, without crediting anyone. In fact, Suno was sued by major record labels and the Recording Industry Association of America last year for that very reason. So then, how are labels still signing deals with AI artists like her? Well, Xania’s songs sound so real that fans can’t tell the difference. Her manager says it’s no different from how remixes of Michael Jackson’s or Prince’s songs keep releasing years after they passed away. And the human behind Xania, Telisha “Nikki” Jones, says she writes the lyrics for every track, only using AI to generate the vocals. In short, if the song hits the right chord, they don’t see a problem. But that’s where things get tricky. Real artists now worry about being replaced by technology that can make endless content — fast. And with streaming services and record labels pouring millions into AI acts, visibility for human musicians could take a hit. Not just that. The Suno lawsuit we mentioned earlier was eventually settled out of court, with Universal Music Group , one of the plaintiffs, now partnering with AI music firms like Udio. Looks like the industry that swore it would never dance with AI… is now moving to its beat. Would you? On that note, here’s a (non-AI 😁 ) soundtrack to put you in the mood 🎵 Salad Days by Jatayu You can thank our reader, Sharang Sharma, for the rec. Ready to roll? What caught our eye this week 👀 Can earthquake resistant buildings be the future of Indian real estate? This week, our team discussions have revolved a lot around climate change. And somehow, the conversation drifted to earthquakes. We started wondering if climate change could actually make cities that weren’t too prone to quakes a little more vulnerable now. Think of Delhi NCR. It’s not sitting on a major fault line, but because it’s close to the Himalayas, it does feel the occasional tremor. Officially, it falls in Seismic Zone IV, the second-highest risk category in India. And as we were reading and talking about all this, we stumbled upon something fascinating. Japan’s real estate market has long earned people’s trust, thanks to its incredibly strict building codes that make structures more resistant to earthquakes. That got us thinking, “Could earthquake-resistant construction be the future of real estate in India too?” But first, some context. Climate change doesn’t directly cause earthquakes. Those come from movements deep in the Earth’s crust. What it does do is change the stress on the crust in certain ways that can make earthquakes more likely. Take melting glaciers, for instance. When they melt, it’s like removing a heavy weight that’s been pressing on the land for thousands of years. The crust beneath then slowly springs back, which can shift stress patterns and sometimes trigger earthquakes. That’s part of what’s happening in the Himalayan region, and by extension, cities like Delhi. Even extreme rainfall can play a role. When rainwater seeps deep into the ground through cracks (called faults), it can increase pressure within those rocks, making them slip more easily. So after years of unusually heavy monsoons, cities like Mumbai, which sits in Seismic Zone III (moderately risky) could be more at risk than before, given its history of nearby faults like Thane Creek and Uran. Then there’s another, slower kind of problem — land subsidence . It happens when too much groundwater is drawn out, causing what’s known as aquifer compaction. Think of an aquifer as a sponge full of water beneath the ground. When you extract too much water from it, say, for agriculture, industry, or city use, the sponge dries up. With less water inside, the soil and rocks above start to compress and sink a little. Over time, that adds up and causes the land above to subside. But these problems aren’t impossible to manage. Japan’s a great example. After the devastating Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, it made earthquake-resistant construction a priority. Building codes were introduced in 1924 and updated constantly since then. The results are stunning. Building collapse rates in Japan dropped from a staggering 76% before 1971 to just about 3% now. And if we take a cue from Japan, cities can’t afford to ignore safety. In the long run, investing in safety pays off. After all, India has lost nearly $80 billion to climate-related disasters in just the last two decades. Rebuilding always costs more than preparing. And with major urban centres like NCR, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, and Mumbai sitting in high seismic zones, building earthquake-resistant structures isn’t optional anymore. It’s the foundation for sustainable urban growth. But there’s a catch. Many big cities are also some of the oldest, which means retrofitting old buildings to make them safer is tough and often impractical in crowded areas. Then there’s affordability. Take Mumbai, for instance. It’s already one of the least affordable cities in India, with average property prices around ₹26,900 per sq. ft. That’s nearly 14 times the average household’s annual income. Global standards suggest that housing should cost up to 5 times one’s income, but in Mumbai, even the top 5% of households would need over a century of savings to buy an average home. Delhi’s no better either. Homes cost over 10 times the average annual income, and nearly 28% of earnings go into EMIs. Now, add higher safety standards to this, like better materials, stricter codes, improved engineering, and costs climb further. That could easily make safety a luxury. So yeah, earthquake-resistant buildings should be the future, but only if we figure out how to make safety affordable and enforce building standards effectively. And maybe that’s the irony. Our own actions are making the ground beneath us shake, and now we’re struggling to afford the safety to withstand it.

With ₹75 lakh crore in assets and 25 crore accounts, it’s a massive industry. But that scale has also brought complex charges and hidden costs that few investors truly understand. So the market regulator, SEBI, now wants to change that. It’s proposed a new rulebook that simplifies how total expense ratios (TERs) are calculated and disclosed. From exit loads and brokerage caps to GST and transaction costs — everything will now show up in a transparent breakdown. There’s even a proposal for performance-linked TERs, where funds that beat benchmarks can charge more, and those that underperform, charge less. This could be a big deal. And for investors, it could mean fewer surprises and fairer fees. But for mutual funds, it may mean tighter margins and a rethink of how they structure costs. You can read about it in our Monday story to know what this overhaul means for your SIPs and the industry at large. The Groww IPO explained Back in 2016, investing in India felt intimidating. Then came Groww, a discount broker with a clean interface, simple onboarding, and educational content that brought millions of first-time investors into the market. Today, it has over 1.2 crore active NSE clients and ₹3,900 crore in revenue. And it’s now heading to the public markets with a ₹6,632 crore IPO. But while the numbers are impressive, there’s nuance. Over 85% of revenue still comes from brokerage, making it vulnerable to trading slowdowns. And a look at the valuations say it’s priced a bit above peers like Motilal Oswal and Angel One. So is this a growth story worth paying a premium for? That’s what we unpacked in our Tuesday newsletter . Bankim Brahmbhatt and the $500 million lesson in lending against thin air Imagine lending $500 million to a telecom firm… only to realise the invoices backing it were fake, the customers didn’t exist, and the borrower had vanished. That’s what happened to HPS Investment Partners, now under BlackRock, and potentially even BNP Paribas. The fraud was allegedly orchestrated by Bankim Brahmbhatt, whose companies secured loans against fabricated customer emails and forged documents. It’s a classic case of asset-backed lending gone wrong. And it’s not because the structure failed, but because the “assets” never existed. Our Wednesday story explains how even billion-dollar institutions can fall for smoke and mirrors, and why old-school due diligence still matters. A breakthrough that might break the internet Google just ran a simulation 13,000 times faster than the world’s best supercomputer using a quantum chip named Willow. That sure sounds exciting, until you realise it could also break encryption! Meaning, with enough power, quantum computers can crack the algorithms that keep your bank logins, emails, and digital signatures secure. And that’s why governments and companies are racing to develop “quantum-proof” encryption, even as quantum computing promises breakthroughs in medicine, materials, and artificial intelligence. And our Thursday story explores both sides of this double-edged chip. What happened to all the T+0 excitement? About a year ago, SEBI’s T+0 dream promised lightning-fast same-day settlement of stock trades. A pilot was launched, deadlines were set, and the future looked imminent. But now, the rollout has been indefinitely postponed. The reason, as it turns out, is that most brokers aren’t ready. The tech upgrade is costly. The trading volumes are too thin. And even investors aren’t excited about paying extra per trade for instant settlement. Worse, global funds can’t easily meet pre-funded trade requirements due to time zone and currency hurdles. All of this has made full T+0 adoption near impossible for now. So until demand picks up, the feature that promised to speed up everything may just be stuck in neutral. But does that mean T+0 is dead? That's what we answer in our Friday newsletter . Liked this week’s wrap-up?

Now on to the story. The Story Unless you live under a rock, you’ve probably seen the “Digital India” ads, and the QR codes, the soundboxes, the card-swipe machines. They all give us a sense of the growth this industry could promise. But behind the scenes of this digital checkout revolution is a messy stack of tech and business logic. And sitting right at the intersection of all this, is a company called Pine Labs which has launched its IPO . If you’ve swiped a card at a retail store, bought something on EMI at Croma, or received a Westside gift card, chances are Pine Labs was involved because it quietly powers about 9.9 merchants. But to understand its business, you need to go deeper than just “the point of sales (POS) terminals”. See, Pine Labs’ biggest play is its ‘Digital Infrastructure and Transaction business’. That’s where the card machines live. But these aren’t dumb swipe boxes, they’re more like mini app stores for digital payments. Pine Labs builds software into these hardware boxes which allows stores to collect payments, manage inventory, issue GST invoices, track rewards, enable EMIs, and even offer working capital loans. There’s a merchant-facing dashboard called ‘Pine Labs One’ that ties all of this together. And this design gives Pine Labs two levers: scale and stickiness. Because once a terminal is installed, every swipe becomes a monetisation opportunity. Pine earns deployment fees, subscription revenue for its value-added services, and a small take-rate on transactions. But because it controls the software layer too, it can plug in new features without touching the hardware — like Dynamic Currency Conversion, loyalty program APIs, or EMI checkout. It’s a classic ‘land-and-expand’ strategy. Then there’s the ‘Issuing and Acquiring’ arm. And although this one’s less visible to you, it’s equally important. Because it’s where Pine Labs rents out its transaction infrastructure. The segment helps brands, banks, and fintechs issue prepaid cards, employee incentives, and closed-loop loyalty programs. It also runs the backend “Credit+” stack that powers debit, credit, and forex cards. So if you’ve received a digital gift card in India, it probably could be from Pine Labs. Especially since its 2019 acquisition of Qwikcilver, which gave it a near-monopoly in that space. But how do these two arms make money for Pine Labs? From its POS and merchant software businesses, it charges merchants for device deployment, monthly software subscriptions, and takes a cut on every swipe. And the issuing and acquiring segment is a B2B engine where brands pay Pine Labs to run their gift cards and employee reward programs. In FY25, the infrastructure segment (POS + merchant software) brought in ₹1,603 crore — about 70% of total platform throughput — while the issuing business added ₹671 crore. Together, they processed over 5.6 billion swipes worth a gross transaction value (GTV) of ₹11.4 lakh crore. So it’s safe to say that Pine Labs has a scaled-up fintech utility today since the time it launched its first service in the early 2000s. But all this scale comes at a cost. Especially when you’re trying to digitise Tier-2 and Tier-3 India — where a big chunk of retailers still rely on notebooks and WhatsApp for inventory. And that’s why Pine Labs is now knocking on the public markets, raising ₹3,900 crore through its IPO. ₹2,080 crore is a fresh issue, while ₹1,820 crore is an offer for sale (OFS). And what’s the new money going towards? About ₹760 crore is earmarked for upgrading infrastructure like deploying more terminals, building out backend tech, and investing in faster, smarter software. Another ₹532 crore will go into repaying old debt — freeing up future cash flows and reducing the company’s reliance on outside capital. And a smaller chunk (₹60 crore) will be invested in its global arms in Singapore, Malaysia, and the UAE — where it has started replicating the India playbook. Sure, the international business is still nascent, but with 15,000 merchants already onboard, it’s not a moonshot either. So no, the IPO isn’t just an exit event for early investors. It’s a calculated reinvestment cycle. In a business where commoditisation is the enemy and software differentiation costs real money, Pine Labs is trying to stay ahead of the curve. But that brings us to the obvious question — can it make a dent doing so? At first glance, Pine Labs looks like it has a wide moat. Over a million merchant touchpoints, strong brand equity, deep integrations with banks, NBFCs, and credit card issuers. It’s also the largest prepaid issuing backend in India. And finally, it has returned to profitability — over ₹4 crore in net profits in the first three months of FY26, after burning cash for years. But look closer and you realise that the moat isn’t a castle wall. It’s more like a treadmill that, when you stop running, the market throws it off. Let us tell you why. Start with merchant concentration: the top 10 clients account for 30% of revenues in FY25. These are large, sophisticated clients who negotiate hard and churn fast. If even one of them switches — say to Razorpay’s POS offering, PhonePe’s new offline play, or MSwipe — the impact on Pine Labs’ metrics could be significant. Second, Pine Labs’ profitability is still precarious. The company hasn’t posted a full yearly profit yet. And while the recent profit is a turnaround, it’s come on the back of strong cost control and flat growth in the issuing business. Meanwhile, the POS business, its true engine, has to keep spending heavily just to stay competitive. Sure, its operating margin has improved from 12% in FY23 to 15% in FY25, but a large chunk of the operating cash flow still gets soaked up by technology and capex. Then there’s the underrated moat-challenger: commoditisation. You see, the more Pine Labs scales, the more it runs into the age-old problem of payment infra. POS terminals are fast becoming commodities. The core hardware looks the same, and UPI has cannibalised low-ticket card volumes where fintech startups are bundling free or subsidised devices with cheaper integrations. So the only way to win seems to make the software indispensable. And honestly, that’s exactly what Pine Labs is trying. It’s doubling down on cross-sells like loyalty APIs, EMI plug-ins, GST compliance, and more, which are all embedded into a sleek merchant dashboard. It’s turning its POS layer into a monetisable app store. And as it adds more features, the cost of switching away increases for merchants. But again, differentiation has a cost. That’s why Pine Labs wants capital. Not just to grow, but to stay sticky. It helps that the issuing business (prepaid cards and gift infrastructure) is far more defensible. Thanks to Qwikcilver, Pine Labs commands a huge share of that segment. Its gift card rails power Amazon, Flipkart, Croma, Myntra, and more. And because these are enterprise clients with API integrations and program-level contracts, they don’t churn easily. Still, growth has not picked up exponentially. Some of it is because of macro factors such as consumption cycles, interest rates, and so on. But some of it is structural. The high-margin Indian enterprise market is largely saturated. The next leg of growth depends on digitising the unorganised middle, where merchants are less loyal, cost-sensitive, and harder to upsell. And that’s not an easy market to win. Which brings us to valuations. Pine Labs wants a market cap of ₹25,400 crore (about $2.9 billion). That, interestingly, is a sharp reset from its 2022 private valuation of $5 billion. So, on a revenue multiple basis, the valuation doesn’t look that frothy. It puts the asking valuation at roughly 11 times FY25 revenues. For context, Paytm still trades at nearly 10 times FY25 revenues despite continuing losses and business pivots. Pine Labs, meanwhile, is inching closer to profits, and its adjusted operating earnings have more than doubled to ₹356 crores in FY25 from ₹158 crores in FY24. But whether it will continue this momentum and turn profitable in the coming years remains to be seen. The industry is no doubt vast and projected to grow to over ₹250 trillion by FY29, but competition and regulatory risks could also derail growth. So yeah, while the valuation may seem modest, the real question is what are you pricing this business as? Is this a growth-stage tech company with levers to pull? A steady, cash-generating fintech utility? Or something in between? And the answer to that could tell you whether this is a high-return opportunity or a reasonable business priced for reasonable outcomes.

In today’s Finshots, we tell you why SEBI has indefinitely extended the deadline for stockbrokers to be fully ready for T+0 settlements. But before we begin, here’s a quick note from our co-founder: “When we started Finshots, our aim was to make finance simple and accessible for everyone. Soon, we realised that understanding finance is just one of the challenges. Making smart decisions, especially around insurance, is a whole different ball game.

If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story. The Story If you even vaguely remember, two years ago we’d written about the market regulator, SEBI’s (Securities and Exchange Board of India’s) big plan to shake up how stock market trades are settled, by introducing something called T+0 . For the uninitiated, when you buy or sell a stock, the trade doesn’t wrap up instantly. Sure, your demat account shows the money you owe or are supposed to receive right away. But the actual funds and shares move only the next day. That’s what we call a T+1 settlement, where “T” is the day you make the trade and “+1” is the following day when the transaction is completed. T+0, on the other hand, promised to make this process lightning-fast with trades settled the same day, all wrapped up by 4:30 p.m. SEBI had launched this neat sounding plan on a pilot basis, starting with just 25 stocks in March last year, and then gradually expanding the list by 500 stocks (in phases of 100 stocks each month) from January this year. The idea was that by May 2025, most brokers would be ready for a full T+0 rollout. But as it turns out, switching to a same-day settlement system isn’t exactly plug and play. The deadline had to be pushed to November 2025. And now, even that’s off the table. Many brokers still aren’t ready with the technology and systems needed for instant settlements. So SEBI has decided to indefinitely extend the deadline , saying it’ll announce a new one later. So what happened to all the excitement around T+0, and why are brokers asking for more time to switch, you ask? Well, the real reason goes a little deeper than just the surface-level “operational difficulties” everyone talks about. And to understand what’s really going on, we need to look at a first of its kind study published in Economic & Political Weekly (EPW) . The paper examined the potential impact of T+0 settlements after the first few phases were rolled out. It tested if faster settlements really improved market efficiency and liquidity as analysts believed. The logic was that when trades settle quicker, the bid-ask spread or the tiny gap between buying and selling prices, tends to shrink. That’s because market makers, the folks who constantly buy and sell stocks, face less risk of the other side not delivering cash or shares or prices changing before a trade is completed. Less risk means tighter spreads and better prices for investors. The researchers looked at two phases: March 2024, when 25 stocks moved to T+0, and January 2025, when another 100 out of 500 additional stocks followed, and used two methods: An event study, which looked at how stock prices and trading volumes behaved around the days T+0 was introduced, and A DiD approach (not Dance India Dance 😁 but “difference-in-difference”), which compared how things changed for T+0 stocks versus similar ones that stayed on T+1. And what they found was pretty interesting. There was early excitement when T+0 went live, but it faded quickly. And there wasn’t any lasting improvement in pricing efficiency or trading activity. In short, faster settlement didn’t really make the market more liquid. At least not yet. Okay Finshots, so why didn’t this happen? You see, for starters, T+0 really benefits active traders, not long-term investors . So if you’re someone who buys a stock and holds it for years, it doesn’t really matter whether the shares reach your demat account in one day or a few hours. And that’s an important point because in India, most investors aren’t traders. They’re long-term participants. Yup! NSE’s MD and CEO, Ashishkumar Chauhan , says only a small fraction actively trade or deal in derivatives. And a survey by Research & Ranking backs this up. About 3 out of every 5 investors (roughly 60%) plan to hold their investments for at least three years. So if the majority of the market doesn’t really need faster settlement, the demand for T+0 was bound to be limited. Then you have to look at the other side — the brokers. For them, moving to T+0 isn’t as easy as flipping a switch. It’s an expensive upgrade. Under T+1, if you trade today (say, on a Friday), the exchange doesn’t settle it immediately. Everyone gets a full working day (until Monday) to sort things out. Buyers move money to their broker, sellers transfer shares from their demat, and brokers reconcile everything before sending it to the exchanges. But with T+0, money, shares, and confirmations, all have to move within a few hours, on the same day. That demands real-time coordination, better infrastructure, and stronger back-end systems, which translates into higher costs. All that would also mean that brokers charge a small premium for T+0, which could come up to an average of about ₹10–₹20 extra per order. But when that cost is passed on to investors, two things happen. First, if you’re a cost-conscious investor who doesn’t trade often, you might feel the faster settlement isn’t worth the extra money. You’d rather save that fee since you don’t need instant credit or delivery anyway. Second, if a lot of investors feel that way, fewer people end up using T+0. And when participation stays low, trading volumes remain thin. That means brokers don’t get the extra liquidity they were hoping for, which makes the whole exercise less profitable. The proof is in the pudding. According to The Hindu Businessline , nearly a year after T+0 was introduced, the NSE and BSE have seen just 83 and 56 trades respectively, worth only ₹7.1 lakh and ₹3 lakh in total. That’s tiny. And these low numbers raise an important question. Is it really worth the investment for brokers to upgrade their systems for T+0? After all, it’s still optional, and with such low trading volumes, the returns on that added investment seem uncertain. So, brokers find themselves in a cost-benefit dilemma : spend more to enable same-day settlement, or hold off until there’s enough demand to make it worthwhile. So, it’s a bit of a vicious cycle, really. In summary, brokers aren’t fully ready operationally, and many remain sceptical about whether T+0 is worth the trouble. Because of that, the benefits of same-day settlement don’t quite show up. And since those benefits aren’t visible, there are fewer takers. With fewer takers, it doesn’t make much business sense for brokers to invest heavily in it either. Round and round it goes. So yeah, we won’t truly know how efficient T+0 can be until it’s mandatorily rolled out across all stocks. But that again is easier said than done. No market in the world has gone fully T+0 yet. Not even the most advanced ones. And there’s a good reason for that. It’s practically impossible for foreign investors. Same-day settlement means all trades must be pre-funded. Money has to be in place before trading begins. For global institutional investors, that’s a logistical nightmare. Time zones, currency conversions, and cross-border transfers make it nearly impossible. Compressing all that into a few hours just doesn’t work. It would not only disrupt FPI (Foreign Portfolio Investor) participation but also hurt liquidity and push up transaction costs even more. That said, T+0 isn’t dead. It’s probably just waiting for its moment. And knowing SEBI’s track record with market reforms, it’ll probably come up with some clever workaround to solve this never-ending puzzle.

But here’s a quick side note before we begin. Trust Finshots for Finance? You’ll love Ditto for insurance. Built by the same four friends behind Finshots, Ditto is here to make insurance simple.

Now on to today’s story. The Story It is believed that hackers around the world are quietly intercepting and hoarding vast volumes of encrypted data, including your biometrics and bank account details, to top-secret research by governments and labs. However, they can’t open these files. At least not today. But within the next few years, they may have a reliable way to access them. In fact, back in 2020, Sundar Pichai predicted that within 5 to 10 years, quantum computing will break today’s encryption systems. And just last week, Google’s Quantum Computing division made a breakthrough in that direction. It successfully ran a new algorithm named Quantum Echoes on the Willow chip. And this achieved a verifiable ‘quantum advantage’. In simple terms, it ran complex simulations 13,000 times faster than the world’s best supercomputer. Even better, the results were reproducible and more reliable, which is something previous quantum experiments struggled with. In short, Google just showed that quantum computing is inching from lab theory to real-world potential, a leap that could soon affect everything from chemistry to finance to cybersecurity. That’s where the real promise of quantum computing lies. Since quantum computers can process so many possibilities simultaneously, they’re uniquely suited for complex simulations and optimisation tasks. For instance, in chemistry and materials science, they could help chemists model molecular interactions precisely to design new drugs, superconductors, or even next-generation batteries. This is something today’s supercomputers struggle to do because the math becomes astronomically complex. However, this alone doesn’t mean that quantum computers don’t come with downsides. The biggest one being that they can easily break modern encryption standards, and destroy the foundation of digital security. And in order to understand how, let’s first see how it works today. Encryption for emails or other digital signatures essentially works by multiplying two prime numbers. Let’s say you log in to a website such as your bank. Your data isn’t sent in plain text. It’s scrambled using a public key, which is a mathematical code made by multiplying two very large prime numbers, often hundreds of digits long. And here’s where the trick lies. Multiplying them is easy. But if someone tries to do the reverse, i.e., figure out which two primes were multiplied to create that massive number, it’s practically impossible for classical computers. This process is called RSA encryption (and yes, it’s built on that prime-factorisation concept my 5th grade maths teacher taught me). This ensures that your data remains secure and reliable and that two people who have never met can exchange information safely. One person encrypts the message using a public key, and the other decrypts it with a private key. To give you an idea of scale, even the most powerful supercomputer today would take billions of years to crack a 2048-bit RSA key by brute force. That’s why the system is considered secure. Your bank details, passwords, and digital certificates all depend on this principle that breaking down a huge number into its prime components takes an unimaginably long time. Quantum computers, however, don’t play by the same rules. They use something called ‘superposition’, which allows them to process multiple possibilities at once instead of checking each one sequentially. To understand this, here’s a famous thought experiment proposed by Erwin Schrödinger, one of the pioneers of quantum physics (you may be familiar with it if you’ve watched the American sitcom, The Big Bang Theory ): A cat is placed inside a sealed box with a small amount of radioactive material that may or may not decay, triggering a mechanism that could release poison. Until someone opens the box, the cat isn’t just alive or dead; it’s both alive and dead at the same time. Its actual state exists as a combination of both possibilities until it’s observed. Source: sciencenotes.org Quantum computers apply the same idea to computing. While classical computers use bits, which can be either 0 or 1, quantum computers use ‘qubits’, which can be 0, 1, or any combination of both simultaneously. This means that a quantum computer can process many possible answers simultaneously, something that no classical computer can do. And with the help of an algorithm known as Shor’s algorithm, a sufficiently powerful quantum computer could factor large prime numbers exponentially faster, effectively breaking the RSA encryption in hours or days. And that’s exactly the threat experts are worried about. It means the same technology that promises breakthroughs in medicine and materials could also render the world’s online banking systems, government communications, and private data completely exposed. That’s why security agencies and corporations worldwide are now racing to prepare for what they call Q-Day (the day quantum computers become powerful enough to break existing public-key encryption). Governments, tech companies, and research institutions are already working on solutions such as “quantum proof” systems. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been running an international competition since 2016 to identify Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms. These are basically new encryption methods that even quantum computers can’t easily crack. In 2022, NIST announced four leading algorithms : CRYSTALS-Kyber for general encryption, and CRYSTALS-Dilithium, Falcon, and SPHINCS+ for digital signatures. These are designed using complex mathematical problems that even the most advanced quantum computers can’t solve efficiently (for now). Meanwhile, companies like Cloudflare are testing hybrid encryption systems that combine traditional encryption, like AES, with quantum-resistant algorithms to safeguard future data transfers. In India, the government launched the National Quantum Mission in 2023 with a ₹6,000 crore investment to strengthen the country’s capabilities in quantum computing, communication, and cryptography. And that’s where the strange irony lies. The same technology that could help us discover new drugs, design better batteries, and solve humanity’s most endearing problems, which we once thought were impossible to solve, could also expose every secret we’ve ever tried to keep. Until then… PS: We used RSA merely as an example. In reality, modern digital infrastructure relies on multiple encryption methods such as AES, RSA, ECC, SHA, ECDSA certificates, etc. Some are more secure than others, but most still remain vulnerable to advances in quantum computing. PPS: Although we didn’t have the opportunity to cite this paper directly, it was interesting to go through how banks and other financial institutions are preparing for Q-Day.

If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story. The Story Imagine for a moment that you’re a multi-billion-dollar alternative credit company. You’ve built a $30 billion portfolio of asset-backed loans, secured against invoices and customer bills that appear rock solid. Everything looks airtight, until one of your employees spots an email address that doesn’t add up. And what follows unravels a staggering truth. That about half a billion dollars of those “assets” don't exist at all. It sure sounds unreal. But this, dear reader, was how HPS Investment Partners, now owned by BlackRock , discovered that $500 million it had lent to a businessman named ‘Bankim Brahmbhatt’ had effectively vanished into thin air. And Brahmbhatt himself had disappeared. But how did it all unfold? Well, it began in September 2020 , when HPS first extended credit to one of Bankim Brahmbhatt’s telecom companies through a financing arm. A veteran of the telecom industry, Brahmbhatt owned two relatively small firms – Broadband Telecom and Bridgevoice. And the debt quickly snowballed from $385 million by 2021, and nearly $430 million by August 2024, just shy of that half-billion-dollar mark. Now, as HPS’s exposure grew, it wanted to be sure everything was real. The firm brought in Deloitte for customer checks, which in turn engaged CBIZ for a deeper accounting review. But nothing unraveled until July this year, when an HPS employee noticed irregularities in the email addresses of the customers of another company linked to Brahmbhatt called Carriox Capital. Yep, email addresses! Some appeared to impersonate real telecom companies, but their domains were fake. And these addresses were the same ones that had appeared in past communications related to Brahmbhatt. When HPS reached out to Brahmbhatt, he brushed it off and told them not to worry. And that would be their last conversation, as Brahmbhatt stopped answering calls. A visit to his Garden City offices in New York brought another twist to the story. The doors were locked, the space vacant, and neighbors stated seeing no one come or go in a long time. Even his home looked desolate, with cars unmoved and one forgotten package gathering dust. All of this only made the suspicion of HPS stronger, and they hired a law firm, Quinn Emanuel, to investigate and get to the bottom of this. And where better to start than the emails, which were quite literally the very “collateral” backing these loans? The investigators soon found that the email addresses quite clearly didn’t match the ones available in public domain, meaning that they might have been fabricated. So no customers meant no assets, and no assets meant HPS’s loans were lent on quicksand. As the probe deepened, it was clear that almost every customer email pledged as collateral over the past two years… was fake. They only ever existed on paper, and some forged receipts even dated back to 2018. So if the customers weren't real, where did the money go? Of the total $500 million, almost half was financed by BNP Paribas to Carriox and related entities. And as for its whereabouts today, the lenders believe that the money might be in India or Mauritius, an infamous tax-haven, though the full money trail is yet to be uncovered. In August, Carriox Capital II filed for bankruptcy , alongside Brahmbhatt’s other telecom companies. Coincidentally, BNP Paribas set aside $220 million in loan-loss provisions in its latest quarterly filings, though we don’t know if that’s connected to this case. So there you have it, the alleged Bankim Brahmbhatt fraud. And all this brings forth the peculiar question: Why do lenders keep ending up on the losing side of stories like this? Well, it probably stems from the very foundation of asset-backed lending. Forget everything else for a minute and picture yourself as the owner of a little, vintage coffee shop. You need cash for supplies, electricity, salaries, and so on. But lenders can’t use your expenses as collateral, they want something tangible. So you point to something that feels and looks real enough i.e. your customer sales: invoices, regular buyers, and pending payments from large clients. The bank sees those future receivables and says, “Alright, we’ll lend you money against these bills.” Here, the bills from your business are the collateral. You’re effectively borrowing against tomorrow’s coffee sales, not from the chairs and coffee beans sitting with you today. But now, instead of coffee, flip the script and imagine you’re selling something intangible like telecom services. You can’t touch or see it, and the only evidence is data. That’s where the problem begins. You can’t verify something intangible. You can’t walk into a warehouse and see if the product really exists or not. The only proof available is invoices sent to customers, email trails of money owed and data on a screen. For a lender who takes these due payments as collateral, that’s all it takes to check the boxes before sanctioning the loan. If the documents look real, the payments are traceable and the customers seem legitimate, everything goes fine. But once it turns out that the paperwork is fiction, the entire structure collapses, because there were never any real assets in the first place. And that’s what makes asset-backed lending so risky, when the assets themselves aren’t physical. The system runs on trust. In Brahmbhatt’s case, the “customers” were the perfect illusion behind that half-billion dollars. This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. Between 2016-19, a special audit report brought out DHFL , a housing finance company, where close to ₹29,000 crores had been funnelled to 66 shell companies that turned out to be the promoters themselves. A classic case of asset-backed lending gone wrong. So how can lenders prevent this from happening again? For starters, stop taking the paperwork at face value. Instead of relying on the borrower’s word, verify payments and customer records by using public domain or official accounts. A simple check of email domain registration could reveal whether a client is a real telecom operator or just a clever imposter with a lookalike address. Then, there’s the money trial. Instead of letting funds flow freely from customer to business to lender, use escrow accounts. These are accounts that release funds only when all parties meet their conditions. That way, the funds don’t disappear overnight to an offshore tax-haven as diversions become visible in real time. And finally, regular quarterly audits should re-check customer activity, receivables, and payments to ensure authenticity over time. This makes it quite difficult to “fake it till you make it,” because every few months, someone’s actually checking whether the customers, cash flows, and contracts actually exist. Together, these steps make long-running frauds harder to pull off. Asset-backed lending is supposed to make loans safer. But when the assets themselves exist only in emails and fictional customers, even billion dollar lenders can be left holding air. Maybe the real lesson here is that old-school verification remains the most valuable asset after all.

https://finshots.in/archive/the-groww-ipo-explained-billionbrains-garage-ventures,2025-11-04,Capital Markets,The Groww IPO explained,"4 November 2025 • Capital Markets The Groww IPO explained In today’s Finshots, we break down Groww’s IPO, which opens for subscription today and closes on Friday (November 7th, 2025). But before we begin, if you like stories that make business and finance actually make sense, then hit subscribe by clicking here . If you’re already a subscriber (or reading this on the app), just scroll down – today's story's a good one. Also here’s a quick disclaimer. Groww is a direct competitor to Zerodha, and Zerodha, through its fund Rainmatter, is an investor in Finshots. Please don’t treat any part of this story as investment advice, and as always, make investment decisions only after conducting your own due diligence. The Story Most of our business stories begin with some unique backstory of how it all started and then shot up to glorious heights. But Groww doesn’t come with that sort of flashy origin tale. Even its legal name, “ Billionbrains Garage Ventures ”, sounds like it should have an interesting story behind it. But it really doesn’t. It feels more like one of those names meant to capture the classic startup dream of humble beginnings and big ambitions. Groww began pretty much the same way and with one simple goal — to make investing easy, especially for everyday people like you and me. When they started, this was a big deal. Because back then, around 2016, the National Stock Exchange (NSE) had only about 50 lakh active investors. Not because Indians didn’t care about growing their money, but because investing felt intimidating, complicated and expensive. And most folks didn’t really understand financial products the way they do now. So four colleagues at Flipkart — Lalit Keshre, Harsh Jain, Ishan Bansal and Neeraj Singh, spotted that gap. They figured that investing shouldn’t feel like solving a puzzle and decided to fix it. And just like that, Groww was born. Cut to today and the picture looks wildly different. The NSE now has upwards of 4.7 crore active investors. So you could say that’s a full-blown retail investing revolution. And a big chunk of that shift came from new-age discount brokers like Groww, who made markets accessible at the tap of a screen. If you’re wondering, ‘discount brokers’ simply let you buy and sell securities (self-directed trading) at low cost through an app, unlike full-service brokers such as Kotak Securities, HDFC Securities or ICICI Direct, who add services like wealth management, research reports and personalised advice to the bill. But how exactly did Groww become a part of this growth story, you ask? Turns out, Groww didn’t do anything wildly complicated. It began as a mutual fund distributor, and once it picked up a broking licence in 2020, it levelled up and became a stockbroker. And the timing couldn’t have been better. From there, things snowballed. It began letting users invest in IPOs, trade in derivatives, picked up an NBFC licence, started offering loans, and eventually climbed its way to becoming the largest broker on the NSE in terms of active clients. In fact, Groww now has over 1.2 crore active NSE clients. And if you look at total trading users, the number has gone from about 10 lakh to nearly 1.8 crore today. Not bad for a company that kept things simple. Groww’s journey since inception /Source: RHP And staying simple wasn’t just about the product. It was the growth playbook too. Groww focused on getting people through the door first — maybe someone only came in to buy mutual funds or trade stocks. Once they were in, Groww kept them around with a clean, simple interface and a smooth experience. And then, slowly, it nudged them towards trying other products like using Groww UPI for payments, dabbling in derivatives, investing in bonds, and so on. The more products a user adopts, the more the company earns per person — or in finance speak, higher AARPU (annual average revenue per user), which has gone up from ₹2,540 in FY23 to ₹3,339 in FY25. Groww’s business model /Source: RHP Content played its part too. Groww pushed out educational posts, videos, and newsletters to keep users engaged and confident about the markets. Those users then spread the word, more people signed up, and the cycle just kept repeating. The proof is in the pudding. Groww’s three-year user retention rate stands at about 78%. In other words, once people start investing on Groww, they tend to stick around for years. And that’s great for the brokerage business. And all this effort has clearly translated into numbers. Groww’s total income has jumped from around ₹1,260 crore in FY23 to nearly ₹4,060 crore in FY25. Its revenue from operations (which excludes other income), roughly ₹3,900 crore, has been growing at a sweet 85% CAGR over the same period. Now, just for context, if you stack this up against two of its largest listed domestic peers (not necessarily new-age brokers, just listed brokers) — Motilal Oswal Financial Services pulled in ₹8,339 crore (growing at 40% CAGR), and Angel One earned ₹5,238 crore (with a little over 30% CAGR). So yeah, Groww’s revenue growth has been eye-catching. And close to 85% of that comes from broking services alone. That’s basically the brokerage fee it earns when users buy and sell securities on its platform. The remaining chunk comes from things like the Margin Trading Facility or MTF (where users can borrow to buy stocks instead of paying the full amount upfront), interest income on loans, and fees from its own mutual fund business through the AMC (Asset Management Company) arm. But revenue isn't the only way to measure how fast Groww has scaled. If you look at active users, they’ve shot up from 50 lakh in FY23 to nearly 1.4 crore by FY25. Net profit has climbed too, from ₹457 crore to about ₹1,824 crore over the same period, although there was a blip in FY24, when it reported an ₹805 crore loss thanks to a one-time tax payment for shifting its parent entity from the US to India. Operating profit margin growth has been solid as well, jumping from 36% to 59%. For comparison, Motilal Oswal and Angel One’s margins in FY25 were 55% and 32% , respectively. Groww’s unit economics /Source: RHP What makes this even more interesting is that Groww builds most of its tech in-house instead of outsourcing. That means no waiting around for external vendors to fix bugs or roll out updates. If investors suddenly ask for a new feature, or SEBI drops a rule change overnight, Groww can tweak things quickly and keep the platform running without hiccups. It also helps the app stay fast, reliable and ready for massive trading spikes without crashing. You can actually see that commitment in the numbers. Their software, server and tech expenses jumped 67% to ₹440 crore in FY25 compared to the year before. And out of the ₹6,632 crore IPO, a small portion or ₹1,060 crore, is a fresh issue, out of which ₹152 crore will go solely towards improving Groww’s cloud infrastructure. The rest of the money will go into marketing and expanding its lending products like MTF and loans. But this also highlights a downside that a big chunk of the IPO is an offer for sale (OFS), which basically means most of the proceeds go directly to existing shareholders cashing out rather than the company itself. So how do you decide whether this IPO is worth betting on? Well, you’ve seen Groww’s strengths. Now it helps to flip the coin and look at the risks too. For starters, Groww still earns most of its money from brokerage services, as we’ve mentioned earlier. And when you're heavily dependent on one revenue stream, things can get shaky. If market sentiment turns sour and users pull back from trading, activity drops. And when activity drops, so does revenue. Then there’s the regulatory angle. Any sudden change from SEBI, RBI or the stock exchanges could throw a spanner in the works. We actually saw something similar unfold in 2024 when SEBI tightened rules around the derivatives market to protect retail investors. It made it harder for small traders to participate by increasing the minimum amount needed to trade in derivatives and traders had fewer short-term trading windows each week. And the impact was immediate. Notional turnover (the total value of all futures and options trades as if traders paid full price, even though they only put up a margin) fell nearly 38% between Q1 FY25 and Q1 FY26, and individual investor participation dropped around 36%. At the same time, SEBI also capped how much brokers could charge relative to exchange fees, which forced Groww to tweak its pricing. As a result, its income from fees and commissions slid from ₹883 crore to ₹728 crore during that period. And of course, this is a tech-first business. So if something breaks on the backend, the platform can go down, and outages are never great for user trust or stickiness. Now coming to valuations, Groww was valued at around ₹58,500 crore in July 2025 and is currently sitting at roughly ₹61,735 crore (at the upper price band of ₹100). That works out to about 16 times its revenue and 31 times its earnings per share (i.e. a price to earnings or P/E ratio of 31x). On the face of it, that doesn’t look too bad when the industry average P/E sits around 40. But remember, its larger listed peers Motilal Oswal and Angel One are trading at P/Es of 24 and 19 respectively. So yeah, compared to them, Groww looks a bit pricey. But maybe that premium is the market’s way of acknowledging what Groww has built — a platform that has pulled millions of first-time investors into the markets using slick tech, financial education, and a clear push beyond just stock broking.

https://finshots.in/archive/why-mutual-funds-will-soon-cost-less,2025-11-03,Capital Markets,Why mutual funds will soon cost less,"3 November 2025 • Capital Markets Why mutual funds will soon cost less In today’s Finshots, we break down the SEBI consultation paper on mutual funds asset management charges. But before we begin, if you’re someone who loves to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance, then hit subscribe if you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story. The Story Over ten years ago, mutual funds were something we or our parents heard about over TV ads, that ended with the note, “Mutual funds are subject to market risks….” But today, they’re a part of almost every investor’s life. If you’re reading this right now, there’s a good chance that you or a friend, relative or colleague has invested in one. The industry scaled up like something never seen before, with assets under management (AUM) growing nearly from approximately ₹12 lakh crore to over ₹75 lakh crore in ten years. That means you’ve contributed to an industry that’s grown more than sixfold in just over a decade. There are over 25 crore accounts today, which basically means that mutual funds are the go-to investment choice of everyday Indians. The industry scaled up like something never seen before, and the asset management companies (AMCs) were more than happy to take your money and invest it for you. A big reason behind this rise was regulatory support. Back in 2012 , SEBI brought in some measures to uplift the entire mutual fund industry. It wanted more investors, wider reach, and a revival of the industry after the 2008 financial crisis. To achieve that, it offered cost advantages to AMCs, allowing them to charge a slightly higher Total Expense Ratio (TER) for investments coming from beyond the top 15 cities. Sidenote: Total Expense Ratio is the total costs tied to running and managing a mutual fund. It’s a fee that the fund house charges you for managing your money. This incentive pushed fund houses to expand distribution deeper into the country. If enough money flowed in from smaller towns and cities, AMCs could raise their expense ratio by 30 basis points (0.3%). Distributors also benefited from the move. They were given a simpler NISM certification , making it easier to onboard and train new agents. Over time, as AMCs and their funds grew in size, so did their overall costs. Plus, SEBI allowed AMCs to levy a few additional charges, such as GST, brokerage and transaction fees, and exit-load fees (which is simply a fee you pay when you redeem your mutual fund investment sooner than expected). Now if you’re wondering why brokerage was kept separate from the TER, it’s because both brokerage and transaction costs are variable, and they vary based on actual trading activity of the fund, whereas the TER is supposed to give a more balanced and reliable number for true costs. This means whether or not the fund bought and sold stocks, it still needed money to pay salaries and staff costs. Now the rules that SEBI had laid out were simple: keep the TER below a certain percentage, which varied based on the size of AUM for the fund houses. And they did just that. If the TER limit set by SEBI was between 1% and 2.25%, fund houses usually kept their base expenses within those limits. As a result, the total cost that investors actually paid was often higher than the stated TER. And since many of these charges were disclosed separately, it was difficult for investors to know the full cumulative cost of their investment. What’s more is when SEBI did research on the cost difference, the true costs of the funds were much higher, and some of the rules and regulations were in place since 1996 and unchanged since then. In those 29 years, the mutual fund industry grew multiple times, making some rules more or less obsolete and outdated today. For example, AMCs had to submit advertisements to SEBI 7 days before they went public, a requirement that's now handled digitally rather than through physical copies. That’s why, in a recent consultation paper released on October 28th, SEBI proposed a sweeping set of changes, starting with how expenses are charged on mutual funds. First up is the exit load. Before 2012, the exit load was also used by AMCs to pay distributors and cover marketing or selling costs. Under the new draft, that flexibility has been removed, though SEBI has added the exit load back for the first two slabs of open-ended schemes. Think of these slabs as size buckets. The first slab is for funds managing up to ₹500 crore, and the second slab for those from ₹500 crore to just below ₹2,000 crore. These buckets decide the expense limits (TER caps) that funds have to follow. A few years later, in 2018, SEBI trimmed the extra charge on exit-load for such schemes from 0.2% to just 0.05%. This better matched the actual exit load amounts received. But now, SEBI wants to scrap this add-on altogether, except for those same first two slabs of open-ended active funds, where it’s allowing a small 0.05% bump in their expense limit to make up for it. Then come the brokerage costs, which have seen a massive cut. Previously, AMCs could charge 12 bps for cash market trades and 5 bps for derivatives. That’s now been slashed to 2 bps and 1 bps, respectively, or an 80% reduction. Even if actual costs rise, fund houses will now have to absorb them within their overall TER. But wait, why limit it? Isn’t brokerage a basic transaction cost? Well, yes and no. The discovery came about when they saw fees on arbitrage funds. These funds make money on a simple concept. If a stock is priced slightly differently on two exchanges or between the cash and futures markets, the fund buys at the lower price and sells at the higher one — pocketing the difference and making a profit. SEBI found that arbitrage funds had much lower brokerage costs (1.18-1.34 bps) compared to other equity schemes (5-12 bps), sometimes differing by up to 11 bps. And it believes these higher costs in equity schemes likely include services beyond simple trade execution, such as research or advisory fees. Which effectively means some investors were being double charged: once under management and advisory fees and another time under brokerage and transaction costs. Building on that, SEBI now wants to simplify and modernise how these costs are presented. Instead of clubbing everything under a single percentage, the new draft proposes a clear breakdown of all expenses. This includes separate disclosures for statutory charges like GST, STT, stamp duty, and CTT, so investors can finally see how much of their money goes where. In fact, the definition of TER itself is now much clearer. It will include brokerage, exchange fees, regulatory fees, and statutory levies, and AMCs must disclose the full breakdown of these expenses to investors. And here’s something new — SEBI has formally proposed an optional performance-linked TER framework. This means AMCs can choose to vary their fees based on how well a fund performs relative to its benchmark. If it outperforms, they can charge more; if it underperforms, they’ll have to charge less. It’s not mandatory yet, but SEBI wants to test if this makes fund costs more merit-based and investor-friendly. Because remember, this is still a draft paper and they’re open to public feedback till November 17th this year. For investors, this overhaul could mean greater transparency and fewer hidden mutual fund costs. You’ll finally know where every invested and earned rupee goes towards your AMC. But for the AMCs, it’s a mixed bag. The compliance burden may ease, but the cost-cutting rules around brokerage and TER could compress margins, unless some costs are passed onto mutual fund distributors. And for SEBI, this is about future-proofing by updating a nearly 30-year-old rulebook to fit a mutual fund industry. Until then… Think someone in your circle believes expense ratios don’t matter?

https://finshots.in/archive/3i-atlas-67-and-more,2025-11-02,Sunny Side Up,"🍳3I/ATLAS, 67 and more...","2 November 2025 • Sunny Side Up 🍳3I/ATLAS, 67 and more... Hey folks! Not long ago, we wrote about skibidi and delulu making it to the Cambridge English Dictionary, and how various words even make it there in the first place. And you might be thinking, “Why are we writing about this again?” But hear us out, because this one’s a little different. So the latest word of the year on dictionary.com isn’t even a real word. It’s a number! Or rather, two numbers. “67” . “Six seven.” And before you ask, nope, it’s not “sixty-seven.” It’s always said as six seven. And that’s about as much as even the folks at the dictionary.com seem to know. Because apparently, nobody really knows what ‘six seven’ means. Not the linguists, not the parents who keep hearing it from their kids, and definitely not the Premier of Victoria, Australia, who admitted at a press conference that it “actually means nothing!” Yet it’s everywhere — in classrooms, TikToks, even memes about a boy now forever known as the “67 Kid.” So how the heck did these two random numbers go this viral, you ask? Well, it started with a 2024 song called “Doot Doot (6 7)” by US rapper Skrilla, which somehow found its way into Gen Alpha slang. And since then, searches for “67” have jumped more than sixfold — and unlike other two-digit numbers, none of them saw anything remotely similar. Source Add a viral hand gesture (both palms bouncing up and down), a few chaotic basketball edits, and a generation itching to confuse their parents… and you’ve got the perfect recipe for nonsense going mainstream. Basically, six seven means… whatever you want it to mean. Sometimes it’s “so-so.” Sometimes it’s a punchline. Sometimes it’s just pure confusion. (“How was school today?” “Six seven!”) Now, this sure is nuts. But that’s also what makes it fascinating. Because it’s not about the definition but about vibe recognition. Like a secret code, a digital shrug and a generational smirk in number form. Because languages go through transitions . For instance, some studies say how teenage girls lead language innovation and have done so for centuries. And maybe today it isn’t just about clarity, but also about chaos, context, and connection. And when a phrase like six seven rockets around the world in months, it tells you something about how fast in-jokes now become vocabulary. A full-blown micro‑language that means absolutely nothing — and somehow says everything. So yeah, six seven might not belong in a spelling bee. But in the age of algorithmic brainrot, it might just be the most accurate word of the year yet. Might be irritating to some, totally nonsensical to the other, and a way of expression to someone else. Six Seven! 🤷 Here’s a soundtrack to put you in the mood 🎵 Kaanthaa by Masala Coffee Ready to roll? What caught our eye this week 👀 What’s 3I/ATLAS Anyway?! You might’ve wondered if there’s extraterrestrial life out there. Not Jadoo on a cycle that you might have seen in ‘Koi… Mil Gaya’ type but something subtler, stranger. Like a cosmic traveller, born before our Sun, and now quietly cruising past Earth with absolutely no interest in us. That’s pretty much what 3I/ATLAS — a comet from another star system – is said to be. Yep. An actual interstellar object and only the third one humanity’s ever spotted. It doesn’t orbit the Sun. It’s not from “our side of the sky.” It’s just… passing through. How did we discover it? Okay, so it was discovered this July by a telescope in Chile, and it immediately raised eyebrows. Because its path was ‘hyperbolic’, meaning it wasn’t looping around anything, just zipping in from one side of the galaxy and back out the other. Like a tourist who doesn’t even stop for photos. But here’s where things get wild. Scientists don’t just spot it and shrug. They study the glow of gas around it (called its coma) to decode what it’s made of. Think of it as space forensics via light. And what did the light say? That this comet is loaded with carbon dioxide, eight times more than water. And that’s weird since most comets around here are watery snowballs. This one? It’s more like a soda can than slushie. But wait, why even talk about it, what does all of this have to do with me, you ask? Nothing major, agreed. But, for starters, it challenges what we thought we knew about how comets form. If this is what space leftovers look like in other star systems, maybe “their” planets, and potential life there, are built from very different ingredients. And maybe Earth is not the cosmic template we assumed it was. But move beyond this fascination, it’s not just science. It’s also shaking up the business of space. Telescopes are racing to spot more of these fly-bys. Space agencies are building “ Comet Interceptors ” or probes that’ll wait in space and chase the next visitor. Even sci-fi writers and game studios are rethinking how to portray “alien arrivals.” Maybe it’s not always dramatic landings and laser beams. Maybe it’s quiet snowballs that remind us how tiny we are. Because 3I/ATLAS isn’t coming to say hi. It won’t blink or burst into flames. But who knows, it might just shift how we think about life, motion, time… and the silent things still left unexplained. And the cool thing is that it’s said that we’ll get to know more answers from 3I/ATLAS in the coming month when it inches closer to Earth before it passes by. Yet, the frightening thing is that it doesn’t give us a scare like the movie ‘Don’t Look Up’ where a giant rock finally crushes Earth after all the tomfoolery from millionaires fail to stop it. Infographic 📊 📺Why “No Cost EMI” is the biggest lie you’ve been sold In 1985, your grandfather bought a Bajaj scooter for ₹7,000 after saving for 3 years. He used it for 15 years and, when it was time for an upgrade, he sold it for ₹4,000. But let’s talk about you . You bought a ₹1.5 lakh phone on “No Cost EMI” thinking it was smart. One year later, it’s worth ₹75,000, yet you still owe ₹82,000. Two years later, you’ve paid ₹1.8 lakh in hidden charges, the phone is worth ₹40,000, and you’re trapped. Meanwhile, over 15 crore Indians are in the same situation, with EMIs on phones, TVs, laptops costing more than what they’re worth. Clearly, we’ve gone from a country of savers to a country of spenders. But how and why did that happen? We unpack that in this episode of Finshots TV. Click here to check it out .

What’s driving the move, how it could unlock fresh foreign capital and why it might also test investor sentiment about PSBs. Click here to read the full markets story. With that out of the way, let’s take a look back at what we wrote this week. RBL’s ticket to the big leagues A decade ago, RBL Bank was a little-known player hustling through partnerships and co-branded credit cards. Its tie-up with Bajaj Finance changed everything — it helped RBL build one of India’s largest credit-card books and put it on the retail-banking map. But when the RBI rewired co-branded card rules, that growth engine sputtered. The bank needed new capital and a faster growth engine. And that’s where Dubai’s Emirates NBD enters the picture. It’s offering a $3 billion investment for a 60% stake, which is the biggest FDI in an Indian bank to date. The deal could lift RBL’s capital adequacy, help it expand its 563-branch network, and plug into Emirates NBD’s global digital expertise. For Emirates NBD, it’s a shortcut into India’s fast-growing market. But are things as simple as they seem? And could the deal define how far India is willing to open its banking sector for mid-tier banks? That’s what we answer in our Monday story . SEBI wants mutual funds to stop chasing pre-IPO deals For years, mutual funds have quietly dipped into the pre-IPO market, buying unlisted shares at early-bird prices. It wasn’t illegal, just a creative stretch of a rule that allowed investments in companies “to be listed.” But SEBI now wants to draw the line. It has told the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) that mutual funds can no longer participate in pre-IPO placements. And the reason is simple. Mutual funds promise daily liquidity and transparent valuations, and unlisted shares offer neither. So if an IPO gets delayed, investors could be stuck with illiquid assets in their portfolios. The move forces mutual funds back to their core which is public markets, while riskier pre-IPO bets could shift to alternate investment funds (AIFs) and private-equity players. But that’s not the only thing changing. Catch Tuesday’s newsletter here to know more about the ripple effects. What you need to know about loans against silver Gold loans are everywhere, from TV ads to shop hoardings at every street corner. But silver-backed loans? They’re almost unheard of. And that’s partly because silver is bulky, volatile, and lacked clear regulations — until now. The RBI has finally standardised lending against silver across banks and NBFCs. It’s introduced uniform purity checks, loan-to-value ratios, and even a gold-to-silver pledge cap. In short, it’s giving silver the same regulatory framework as gold, but with limits to keep lenders safe. This change could open up formal credit access for many Indians who own silver but not gold. And we broke it all down in our Wednesday story . The Orkla India (MTR Foods) IPO From your morning upma mix to your evening curry masalas, chances are an MTR or Eastern Condiments packet was involved. And their parent, Orkla India, just closed a ₹1,667 crore IPO, which was a complete offer for sale. MTR’s journey began in a 1924 Bengaluru restaurant before evolving into a packaged-foods empire. And today it sells masalas, ready-to-eat meals, vermicelli, pickles, and sweets across 1.82 lakh tonnes of annual production and nearly 2,000 distributors. And its southern stronghold drives double-digit growth and strong operating profit margins, making it one of India’s steadiest FMCG players. But the spice trade is volatile. Prices swing with harvests, suppliers are concentrated, and storage mishaps can turn expensive fast. And our Thursday's newsletter takes you through the full recipe behind the business — its strengths, risks and numbers. The Lenskart IPO explained Lenskart finally hit the markets this week, pitching itself as India’s tech-driven eyewear revolution. With 2,800 stores, 7 million loyalty members, and its first-ever annual profit, the pitch sounds tempting. But look closer, and the picture isn’t as clear. More than half of that ₹297 crore profit came from accounting gains, not core business operations. Promoters are offloading ₹5,128 crore worth of shares in a ₹7,278 crore issue, and yet the company’s asking for a ₹70,000 crore valuation which is nearly 10 times its FY25 sales. Sure, India’s eyewear market is massive and under-served, and Lenskart has a strong head start. But investors may need 20/20 vision to see past the glossy valuation story.

https://finshots.in/markets/can-foreign-capital-fix-psu-banks,2025-10-31,Markets,Can foreign capital fix PSU banks?,"31 October 2025 • Markets Can foreign capital fix PSU banks? In today’s Finshots, we tell you about the proposal to relax the foreign institutional investor cap for public sector banks from 20% to 49%, and the good and bad of it. But before we begin, if you’re someone who loves to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance, then hit subscribe if you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story. The Story There’s a quiet policy shift being whispered around Delhi. That the government may soon raise the foreign institutional investment (FII) cap in public sector banks (PSBs) from 20% to 49% . The move, still at the inter-ministerial discussion stage, has the classic trappings of a big-bang reform. It sends a signal to the world that India’s ready to liberalise the last bastions of state control. And most seductively, as per an analysis, it could unleash up to $4 billion in passive foreign inflows, as PSU bank weights get re-rated in global indices like MSCI. So no wonder the markets cheered, PSB stocks popped and commentators clapped. The logic makes sense. Private banks have been able to get 74% foreign FDI. The RBL Bank and Yes Bank stake acquisitions are recent examples. So why limit state run banks of this capital, no? But if you look closer, it also brings up a few complicated questions. Do India’s PSU banks need capital? Sure. But will foreign capital help? Maybe. To understand why, we need to rewind to the 1970s. That’s when India nationalised its top banks. It was a time of socialist planning, state-led lending, and institution-building. But to make sure new government-owned lenders weren’t eventually captured by private hands again, lawmakers inserted a clever clause into the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970: even if a private shareholder owned more equity, they couldn’t exercise more than 10% voting rights. That way, the power stayed with the government, and it was a telling that the ownership could be diluted, but never influenced. So even as the government considers raising the FII limit to 49%, the voting rights cap is likely to stay at 10%. In other words, a foreign investor can own nearly half the bank, but still have no say in how it’s run. And that tells you something important. This isn’t about handing over control but more to do with handing over risk. Because public sector banks, for all their improved profitability in recent years, are still fragile. They’re still expected to open branches in rural villages where no private lender dares to do so. They’re still saddled with social mandates (from MSME credit to farm loans to Jan Dhan accounts). And they still lend based on nudges from the government. So when India’s economy grows, averaging 8% in the last three fiscal years, and when deals in India’s financial sector have jumped around 130% to $8 billion between January and September, the pressure on PSBs to lend more also grows. For this, they need capital. But recapitalising them through the budget is politically tricky as a lot of taxpayer money has already been used to plug the bad loan or non-performing assets (NPA) holes in the past decade. And that’s where the foreign capital enters. It can allow passive money to come in and also lets index funds increase their stake in PSBs. But that’s not necessarily a good thing. Because capital, in itself, isn’t the biggest bottleneck anymore. Sure, PSBs have done a decent job of cleaning the house post-2015. They have been recovering a higher percentage of bad loans. Plus, the much needed reforms that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) rolled out in the past few years have made them more efficient, and helped them post the highest profits during FY25. Nevertheless, you can’t miss that much of this progress was also a product of favourable macro tailwinds like lower interest rates, government-led capex that created loan demand without much risk, and a natural credit upcycle. And perhaps the next decade will not be as forgiving. We’re moving into a world where banking isn’t just about who lends. It’s about who attracts deposits, who offers the best customer experience, and who can defend its turf in a world of UPI, fintechs, and AI-driven processes. On that front, PSBs are falling behind . Their household deposit market share has shrunk from 70% in 2015 to about 60% today . Urban savers are fleeing to higher-yield savings accounts and slicker private bank apps. Even rural users are warming to non-banking finance corporations (NBFCs) and microfinance players. So yes, throwing more foreign money at the problem won’t solve it. In fact, it could create new vulnerabilities. Because here’s the thing: FII inflows are not always benign. Especially when they’re passive, benchmark-linked flows. MSCI, for instance, assigns index weights based on foreign room (which is the difference between a stock’s FII holding and the maximum allowed). Now, if the cap rises to 49% and foreign ownership is low, the stock weight in the index goes up, and index funds are forced to buy those banks. But this overweightness also amplifies the downside when foreign funds leave the banks. Plus, not all PSU banks benefit equally. Take the State Bank of India (SBI). It’s already widely owned and has a decent index presence. A higher cap may not budge its weight much. But banks like UCO Bank or Punjab & Sind Bank that have low existing FII holdings and more headroom could see big upgrades. And just relying on foreign capital could also breed complacency. If banks start to believe that market support is a function of foreign headroom rather than actual competitiveness, what incentive remains to fix the real issues? Now you might say, fine, but more institutional ownership means more scrutiny and better governance. And you’d be right. There is indeed empirical evidence that when foreign capital participates in banks or firms, it often correlates with improved governance outcomes. For instance, foreign banks and FII-heavy firms often show better disclosure standards and more board-level oversight. But that improvement isn’t automatic or guaranteed. Two conditions matter. First, the voting power. If institutional investors lack meaningful rights, their ability to influence governance is structurally weakened. And second, investment horizon. If the investor is passive, benchmark‑chasing and uninterested in long‑term value creation, the incentive to engage, monitor or demand reform falls away. So what would real reform look like, you ask? Well, it could start with tying capital to outcomes. If FIIs are being invited to invest, the money shouldn’t just go to buffers but fund transformation. Things like cybersecurity, core banking tech, digital onboarding, credit analytics. It would also mean addressing deposit attrition head-on. PSBs need to win back trust. That means better products, faster customer service, and the ability to compete with the fintech ecosystem on experience. And finally, it would mean revisiting the question of governance inclusion. Today, non-government shareholders can’t vote beyond a cap. But at the same time, there’s also a dearth of government leadership. Take Bank of Baroda or Indian bank, for example. They should have 16 directors but only have 10 . That disincentivises long-term strategic investors and blocks accountability. So yeah, in the end, the 49% proposal isn’t meaningless. It sure has teeth. But it’s also just incomplete since it seems like a headline now that hints at reform, without the fine print to prove it. And unless that fine print shows up soon in circulars, budgets, or branch-level execution, this could be another case of banking on optics over outcomes. The market may love the story. But unless the story changes inside the banks themselves, we’ll be back here in a few years. Asking the same question. “Where did all the money go?” And let’s just hope it’s not too late to find out.

https://finshots.in/archive/the-lenskart-solutions-ipo-explained,2025-10-31,Capital Markets,The Lenskart IPO explained,"31 October 2025 • Capital Markets The Lenskart IPO explained In today’s Finshots, we break down the Lenskart Solutions IPO, which opens for subscription today (October 31st) and closes on November 4th (Tuesday). But before we begin, if you’re someone who loves to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance, then hit subscribe if you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story. The Story The Lenskart IPO finally opens today. And if you’ve been scrolling through market chatter, you’ve probably read one line over and over, everywhere: “Lenskart is overvalued.” So, let’s do something fun. Let’s pretend that the IPO is actually a Shark Tank India pitch. Except this time, the sharks are investors like you and me. * Shark Tank India theme music plays. Lenskart’s Chairman, MD, CEO and co-founder, Peyush Bansal and Chief Financial Officer, Abhishek Gupta walk in with trademark confidence. Polite investors nod all around * Bansal: Hello, sharks! My name is Peyush Bansal, and this is our CFO Abhishek Gupta. We’re here to talk about a problem that touches millions of Indian families, and honestly, everyone in this room too. At some point, we’ve all gone to a neighbourhood optician. We’ve waited, been told to come back in a few days, guessed whether the price was fair, and when the glasses finally arrived… we weren’t even sure if the power felt right. Now, for something as basic as being able to see properly, the experience was slow, uncertain, and honestly, kind of outdated. So we asked ourselves: why can’t buying eyewear be as seamless as ordering clothes online? That thought became Lenskart. We wanted to make buying eyewear as simple and delightful as buying fashion online, and to bring world-class vision solutions within reach of every Indian. So instead of every small shop cutting lenses in the back room with inconsistent quality, we built a fully centralised, technology-driven supply chain. Today, your glasses aren’t made by one technician. They’re made in advanced automated factories. Robots cut lenses, precision machines polish them, every pair goes through stringent quality checks, and in most major cities, it reaches your doorstep in as little as a day. We didn’t stop at manufacturing. We created India’s largest digital eyewear experience with virtual try-ons, AI-based face and size detection, and paired it with a national store and home-eye-test network. Customers browse online, try in store or at home, and receive centrally manufactured eyewear. So, whether you start online and finish offline, or the other way round, the journey is seamless. Today, Lenskart operates over 2,800 stores worldwide, including more than 2,100 across India. Our loyalty programme has over 7 million paying members. Our factories in Bhiwadi and Gurugram produced more than 6 million frames last year alone, and we’re now building one of the world’s largest eyewear facilities in Hyderabad. We are also present in Japan, Singapore, Thailand, and the Gulf, and India’s tech and supply chain backbone powers this international growth. So Sharks, as we head to the public markets, we’re inviting India to own a piece of the country’s largest and fastest-growing eyewear brand by offering 11% equity for ₹7,278 crores. This capital will help us scale our technology, expand to more cities, deepen manufacturing, and take world-class eyewear from India to Asia and beyond. We’ve already changed how India buys eyewear. Now, we want to change how the world sees it. * sharks continue to smile * Shark 1: So you’re calling yourself a tech-driven eyewear company. But you’re asking for a valuation that’s higher than many tech firms. Can you walk us through the numbers, so we understand why? Bansal: Sure. Last year (FY25), we did around ₹7,000 crores in revenue. Over the past two years, our revenue has grown at about 33% a year. And we’re not just growing. We’re getting more efficient too. Our operating profit margin has improved from 6.8% in FY23 to 14.6% in FY25. In Q1 FY26, it touched 17.7%. That’s happening because revenue went up, and we controlled costs better. For instance, our marketing spend as a percentage of revenue dropped from 7.7% to 6.7% over two years because our online ads and app don’t just drive online sales, they also bring people into our physical stores. So one marketing spend works in two places. We’ve also been shifting store formats. Earlier, many stores were franchise-owned and operated (FoFo). Now, we’re focusing more on Company-owned and Company-operated (CoCo) stores. These give us more control over pricing, product mix and customer experience. And they pay back investment faster too, roughly in 10 months. To accelerate that, we even bought Dealskart — one of our biggest franchise operators, which helped us add more CoCo stores and improve margins. In March 2025, we had 1,749 CoCo stores. Today, we’re at 1,823 and still growing. And yes, we finally turned profitable in FY25, with ₹297 crore profit. Shark 2 * interrupts *: How much loss did you make the previous year? Bansal: Around ₹10 crore. Shark 2: So your profit jumped nearly 300% in one year? Tell us how that happened. Gupta: I’ll answer that. Our revenue grew about 23% over last year, thanks to strong demand and our international push. And speaking of global expansion, in 2022, we bought Owndays, a big Japanese eyewear chain. But we acquired only 93%, with an agreement to buy the rest later. That remaining stake basically sat on our books as a liability — money we’d have to pay minority shareholders eventually. Now, accounting rules say that we have to revalue such liabilities every year based on current market value. This year, we bought another 4%. And when we revalued the remaining liability, its value dropped a lot. Meaning, we’d likely need to pay less than what we estimated earlier. That drop counts as a profit on paper, even though no cash actually came in. That one adjustment alone added ₹167 crore to profits in FY25. Shark 1: Wait… that’s more than half your total profit! Gupta: Yes. Shark 1: So without that, your real profit is what… ₹130 crore? Gupta: Not exactly. We also earned ₹8 crore because of favourable exchange rates abroad. That could go up or down in future. And we booked ₹14 crore as deferred tax credit. Basically, we had set aside more for taxes earlier but ended up paying less. So we recognised that difference as profit. Shark 3: Okay. But then how do you justify this valuation? This is your first profitable year since you started in 2008. Revenue is growing at 20–30%, but most of the profit this year came from accounting adjustments. And you want a ₹70,000 crore valuation, which is nearly 10 times your sales and 230 times your earnings?! Bansal: Look, there’s no listed peer like us. Traditional rivals like Titan Eye+, GKB, Lawrence & Mayo, and Vision Express are far behind with at least 65% lower revenue than ours in India. And we’re building future-tech — smart glasses, audio eyewear, AI-powered products. We already have a partnership with Qualcomm for next-gen smart glasses. * Bansal and Gupta smile nervously * Shark 1: So you’re asking us to pay a premium based on future potential. I like the vision, but I’m sorry, it feels too aspirational at this stage. So I’m out. And that wraps up our little Shark Tank episode. But here’s the real takeaway. Lenskart’s last private valuation was around ₹8,700 crore in July this year. Now, just a few months later, it’s asking the public markets to value it at nearly 10 times that. That jump feels… ambitious. Sure, Lenskart is unique. It controls everything from making the lenses to delivering the glasses. And the eyewear market in India has massive potential. As of FY25, 770 million Indians needed vision correction. That’s 53% of the country. And by 2030, 940 million people will need glasses. That’s nearly 6 in 10 Indians, thanks to more screen time, pollution, and an ageing population. But even though so many people need eye-care, only about 35% of the population actually wears prescription glasses. In developed countries like the US and Japan, that number is anywhere between 69% and 88%. That’s a huge gap. And Lenskart wants to close it through remote eye tests, more stores, and awareness. It has just 4% market share right now, which means there’s a lot of room for growth. And it wants to be accessible across price points, whether it’s the sub-₹2,000 category or the ₹10,000-plus category, which surprisingly contribute equally to revenue. Sounds exciting, we know. But there’s a catch. A major portion (₹5,128 crores) of the ₹7,278 crore IPO will go to promoters selling their stake through an offer for sale. Only ₹2,150 crores will go towards business growth. The promoter holding will also drop from 20% to 17.5% after the IPO, which may not be terrible. But it does suggest that the promoters are happily cashing in when they can, while you and I are being shown the big vision story. On that note, we’d like to end with a statement Peyush Bansal gave to The Arc : “There is a lot of opaqueness in the eyewear space. No pun intended. There is only 5-10% reality, and 90% is just showcasing and marketing…” We hope this isn’t true for the pitch Lenskart has made to capital-market investors. Although, the valuations, as we saw, scream so. Until then… Don’t forget to share this story on WhatsApp , LinkedIn , and X . How Strong Is Your Financial Plan?

https://finshots.in/archive/the-orkla-india-mtr-foods-ipo,2025-10-30,Capital Markets,The Orkla India (MTR Foods) IPO,"30 October 2025 • Capital Markets The Orkla India (MTR Foods) IPO In today’s Finshots, we talk about the Orkla India IPO, better known as the parent company of MTR Foods, Eastern and Rasoi Magic, which closes for subscription tomorrow (October 31st). But before we begin, if you love keeping up with the buzz in business and finance, make sure to subscribe and join the Finshots club, loved by over 5 lakh readers. Already a subscriber or reading this on the app? You’re all set. Let's get started with the story! The Story Take a quick look at your kitchen jars or recall the last few meals your family cooked. If you’ve made sambar, curry, rasam, or even a lip-smacking biryani lately, chances are you have this company to thank. We’re talking about Orkla India, better known for its subsidiaries, MTR Foods and Eastern Condiments. In a market where most players chase snacks, sweets, and dairy, it has stuck to its spice roots and taken them global. And now, after nearly two decades of simmering success, the company is ready to serve its next course — an IPO worth ₹1,667 crore, which is a complete offer for sale (OFS). Meaning, none of that money goes to the company. Instead, the Norwegian parent, Orkla ASA, is cashing out a portion of its stake after 18 years in India. To give you a bit of context, Orkla is headquartered in Norway, and its Indian story began in 2007 , when it acquired MTR Foods for ₹353 crore. But how exactly did MTR come to be? Well, the legacy actually began as a restaurant, way back in 1924 , when Mavalli Tiffin Rooms opened its doors in Bengaluru. It became a household name for authentic South Indian meals. And over time, the restaurant’s success led to the creation of MTR Foods, which began selling packaged mixes so people could recreate those flavours at home. And that’s how, through MTR Foods, Orkla got a taste of what India truly wanted: consistency without compromise. Over time, it acquired Rasoi Magic in 2013 and Eastern Condiments in 2021, a Kerala-based spice major with a loyal following. Finally, in 2023, these diverse flavours came together under one roof as Orkla India, a spice powerhouse with its heart in South India and its mind set on the world. Spices, of course, are what put India on the map. Nobody produces, consumes, or exports as much as India does. But here, spices aren’t just a commodity. They’re culture. A single flavour rarely fits all. That’s why regional specialists like MTR and Eastern thrive in the South. The region alone accounts for 35% of India’s spice market, more than any other part of the country. Plus, spices are just one slice of a much bigger story — India’s packaged foods industry, which includes everything from flour and oils to dairy and meat, and is worth a staggering ₹17 lakh crore. Within that, Orkla India’s addressable market of spices and convenience foods, stands at about ₹42,400 crore, projected to grow at nearly 11% per annum till 2029. But then it wasn’t always like this because a few generations ago, families bought whole spices and took them to the local mill, fine-tuning the proportions to their own taste. The smell of freshly ground masalas filled every neighbourhood. But as cities grew busier and kitchens smaller, convenience became the new luxury. And that’s how packaged spices exploded. Today, just eight major brands control 57% of the market, split between pure spices (which form 66% or about ₹23,000 crore) and blended spices (the rest 34% amounting to ₹11,500 crore). So how does Orkla India stand apart in this market, you ask? By not just being a spice company anymore but diversifying into a six-category FMCG player. From masalas and ready-to-eat meals to vermicelli, sweets, pickles, and snacks, it’s managed to sneak into every pantry shelf. On the other hand, competitors like Tata Consumer Products (TCP), Aachi, GRB, and Everest cover only four or five categories at most. And if you look behind the scenes, Orkla India follows a hybrid production model, with 1.82 lakh tonnes made in-house across 9 factories, while outsourcing to 21 partner units in six Indian states and a few overseas. This is in line with industry practice and it keeps costs efficient. Its distribution network is just as vast. With 834 distributors, 1,888 sub-distributors, and 6 quick and e-commerce partners, it has the kind of reach most FMCG firms crave. But the real stronghold remains the South, where the Eastern Condiments acquisition nearly doubled its household reach in Karnataka from 8.8% in 2021 to 20% by 2024. Some states like Telangana saw almost ten fold expansion in market share (from just 1.5% to 12.7%) in the same period. Looking at the numbers, the company has kept pace with growth, earning ₹2,394 crore in FY25, with 79% of its revenue coming from India, an EBITDA (operating profit) margin of 16.6% and a profit margin of 10.7% (₹255 crore). Between FY22–FY25, it clocked an EBITDA CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of 18.6%, while its ROCE (return on capital employed), a measure of how efficiently a company turns its investments into profits, stands at 32.7%. For comparison, that’s well ahead of TCP’s 24.6%. TCP also posted ₹17,618 crore in revenue, with slightly lower margins but a faster 12.3% CAGR. In contrast, Orkla India’s 9.2% CAGR reflects a steadier, premium-focused growth. Coming to the IPO, the price band is set at ₹695–₹730 per share, valuing the company at around ₹10,000 crore. That’s a fraction of TCP’s ₹1.14 lakh crore market cap. But that’s part of its charm: it’s a niche FMCG player with healthy margins. Orkla India has built a strong, domestically driven business. But even a well-run spice empire has its share of risks. The spice trade is famously volatile and prices fluctuate with harvests, weather, and global demand. In FY25, for instance, raw and packaging materials alone made up 56% of total expenses (₹1,174 crore). So any shift in the weather, fall in harvests or impact to its 216 suppliers can be bad for business. Which brings us to supplier concentration risk. A third of the raw materials come from just 10 suppliers. Add to that foreign parent dependency, since Orkla’s Norway-based parent will continue to hold a majority stake and provide crucial services to its India arm. In such a setup, even a small disruption, be it a delayed shipment, a policy change, or a strained partnership, can set off a butterfly effect, rippling from the supply chain all the way to the packaged spice blends. Then there’s storage. Spices have a short shelf life, and because of that, any mishandling or a hint of moisture could ruin entire batches. You also need to look at exported goods, which face strict food safety standards, especially after last year’s “ masala scare .” While Orkla India’s brands weren’t necessarily named in the list of contaminated spices, the international spectacle caused a dent to the Indian spice industry. Compliance builds global trust and pricing power, but one slip-up, even beyond the company’s control, can invite costly recalls and reputational damage. And lastly, there's the legacy risk. Today, nearly a century later, the restaurants and the packaged food business are entirely separate. The original restaurants that built the MTR legacy now operate independently and only license the MTR name, while Orkla India owns and runs MTR Foods. Yet that shared legacy cuts both ways. So any slip-up on the restaurant side, even though Orkla has no control over it, can still ripple into the packaged food brand’s reputation. So yeah, Orkla India’s IPO offers more than just a play on packaged foods. It’s a bet on how global expertise can blend with local taste. Strong margins, a focused product line, and deep regional loyalty make it a steady FMCG contender. But the spice business can be unpredictable. One wrong mix in pricing, supply, or perception can tip the balance fast. And only if Orkla India can manage that volatility while keeping its local flavour intact, its market debut might just turn out to be as flavourful as the products it sells. Until then… Fun Fact: The MTR restaurant used to call itself the Brahmin Coffee Club. After moving to Bengaluru’s Mavalli locality near Lalbagh, it earned the name we know today: Mavalli Tiffin Rooms.

https://finshots.in/archive/what-you-need-to-know-about-loans-against-silver-rbi-lending-against-gold-and-silver-collateral-directions-2025,2025-10-29,Policy,What you need to know about loans against silver,"29 October 2025 • Policy What you need to know about loans against silver In today’s Finshots, we break down the RBI’s new rules on lending against silver and why everyone is so upbeat about it. The Story “ Jab ghar mein pada hai sona, tab kahe ko rona? ” You’ve probably heard that catchy Manappuram Finance jingle at some point because gold loan ads are on TV, YouTube, radio, everywhere. But think about it for another second and tell us, have you ever seen or heard an ad for a silver-backed loan? Chances are, you haven’t. And it’s not because advertisers forgot about silver. It’s because silver-backed loans never really caught on in India. Now, there are a few simple reasons for that. For starters, gold has always enjoyed celebrity status in finance because it isn’t just another shiny metal. It has history, emotion and economics attached to it. For centuries, entire monetary systems were built on gold . Countries used it to back their currency during the gold standard era. And even today, when global tensions flare and economies wobble, central banks quietly add more gold to their reserves. It acts like a safety net when chaos hits. Even India has had its own dramatic gold story. Back in 1991, when the country was grappling with a balance of payments crisis, it pledged 67,000 kg of gold to the IMF to secure an emergency loan. That’s how trusted gold is as collateral. So yeah, gold isn’t just jewellery, it's an international financial instrument, a store of value and a symbol of prosperity and stability. Okay, Finshots, but silver also has value. So why did it never enjoy that same kind of financial reputation, you ask? Well, there are a few and very practical reasons why lenders prefer gold over silver. The biggest one to begin with, is storage. See, silver may look light and shiny, but from a lender’s perspective, it’s a storage nightmare. Let’s take a simple example. Suppose you pledge ₹1 lakh worth of gold and ₹1 lakh worth of silver. At today’s prices, ₹1 lakh of gold comes to roughly 8 grams. That’s easy to store and fits into a tiny locker. But ₹1 lakh worth of silver? That’s over 600 grams. Suddenly, you're dealing with bulky metal that needs more storage space, more security, and more insurance. And lenders charge storage fees based on weight or space. So, more silver means more cost for them. Naturally, that makes silver a less attractive business. But that’s not the only headache. Silver’s price swings like a mood. Over 50% of global silver demand comes from industries in electronics, automobiles, solar panels, medical equipment, you name it. So when the economy slows down or industries cut down production, silver prices react sharply. In fact, silver can be two to three times more volatile than gold on any given day. Gold, on the other hand, is more stable because it isn’t tied to industrial demand in the same way. Now keep this in mind and imagine what could happen if a borrower defaults on a silver-backed loan. The bank has to sell that silver to recover its money. But since silver isn’t as liquid as gold, it doesn’t attract buyers as easily or as quickly. And that’s bad news for lenders because if prices fall during that waiting period, they take a hit. Simply put, it’s a big risk. Besides, for years, there was another problem — that of regulation. Unlike gold, silver didn’t have a standard RBI-approved framework for things like purity checks, documentation, valuation or resale. So if something went wrong, say, a dispute over purity or a borrower refusing to pay, there wasn’t a clear legal path to recovery. That scared most lenders away. Which is why silver-backed loans did exist, but mostly in unorganised corners of the market. Local lenders or a few NBFCs would accept silver as collateral, but loan terms were messy. Low LTVs or loan-to-value ratios (which we’ll discuss in a bit), no standard pricing, no accountability if the pledged silver went missing. Basically, it was risky for both borrower and lender. That pretty much sums up why gold became the poster child of secured lending. But the RBI now wants to change that old story. So, about a month ago, it quietly amended the Lending Against Gold and Silver Collateral Directions . In simple terms, it wants to bring silver-backed loans into the formal banking system with just one standard framework for everyone. The new directions apply to commercial banks, co-operative banks, NBFCs and housing finance companies. All of them must follow the same rules by April 2026. Earlier, each lender had its own way of valuing silver, setting purity checks, loan limits and other processes. It was messy, inconsistent and risky. Now, thanks to the RBI, the entire system is getting a single rulebook. So what do these rules actually say? For starters, lenders can only give loans against specific types of collateral like gold and now silver ornaments, jewellery and coins. Raw bullion, like bars and biscuits, is off the table. So are financial products linked to gold or silver, like ETFs. The RBI also made one thing very clear. Borrowers can’t take these loans to buy more gold or silver, nor can they use them for speculation or trading. Basically, these loans are meant for genuine financial needs, not commodity hoarding or investment games. Then comes the LTV rule. It simply decides how much money you can borrow against your pledged metal. The RBI has kept this straightforward: up to 85% of the value if your loan amount is ₹2.5 lakh or less, 80% for loans between ₹2.5 lakh and ₹5 lakh, and 75% for anything above ₹5 lakh. These ratios apply equally to gold and silver now. That levels the playing field and gives silver its long overdue legitimacy in secured lending. But the most significant rule in this new framework is the gold-to-silver ratio of 10:1. Simply put, it means a borrower can pledge only up to 10 kg of silver and a maximum of 1 kg of gold if they’re pledging ornaments, or 500 g of silver alongside 50 g of gold if they’re pledging coins. And while it may seem like a random ratio at first glance, there’s a solid reason behind it. Remember how banks were always hesitant to lend against silver because of its volatility, storage hassles and poor liquidity during defaults? This cap directly tackles that problem. Silver is far more affordable than gold, which means people could easily pledge large amounts of it. And that’s risky for lenders because more silver means more storage cost, more handling risk and more exposure to price swings. So by capping how much silver can be pledged, the RBI is essentially telling banks, “Go ahead and lend against silver, but don’t drown yourselves in it.” The timing of this move is interesting too. Silver prices have been on a sharp rise lately, not just because of jewellery demand but because industries love it but also because last year, Russia even said it plans to add silver to its State Reserve Fund for the first time. As a result, silver prices have jumped nearly 39% in the last six months, much more than double gold’s 18% gain. But even with that price rise, silver is still the poor man’s gold. And that’s exactly why the RBI wants to prevent banks from overloading their loan books with silver alone. One big crash in silver prices and things could go south very quickly. And this ratio is simply a risk shield. What it also does is open up formal credit access to millions of people who own silver but not gold. A 2019 World Gold Council survey found that while 60% of Indian women owned gold jewellery, a close 57% owned silver jewellery. That gap is marginal and it also means that silver is sitting in cupboards across the country — idle, unused and earning nothing. But now, thanks to standardised rules, people can finally use it as collateral to raise funds when needed. And there’s more good news for borrowers. For loans up to ₹2.5 lakh, lenders won’t ask for a detailed credit history. That makes it incredibly useful for people who are new to formal borrowing like farmers, small shop owners, gig workers, household businesses or anyone who needs quick money without complicated paperwork. These small loans can even help borrowers build a credit score, making future loans easier. So yeah, if you’ve heard the recent rumour that the RBI has suddenly allowed silver-backed loans, we hope this story cleared things up. Silver backed loans already existed. What the RBI has done now, is bring order to the chaos. It has standardised silver lending by setting rules, removed confusion and protected both banks and borrowers. And that means silver finally has a formal seat at the lending table. And for millions of Indians, that could change everything.

https://finshots.in/archive/sebi-wants-mutual-funds-to-stop-chasing-pre-ipo-deals,2025-10-28,Capital Markets,SEBI wants mutual funds to stop chasing pre-IPO deals,"28 October 2025 • Capital Markets SEBI wants mutual funds to stop chasing pre-IPO deals In today’s Finshots, we try to explain why mutual funds can no longer access the pre-IPO market. But before we begin, if you like stories that make business and finance actually make sense, then hit subscribe by clicking here . If you’re already a subscriber (or reading this on the app), just scroll down – today's story's a good one. The Story “All investments by mutual fund schemes in equity shares and equity-related instruments must be made only in securities that are listed or to be listed on a recognized stock exchange.” That’s Clause 11 of the Seventh Schedule of the SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996. In simple terms, it says mutual funds can invest only in companies that are already listed or soon to be listed. But that tiny phrase “to be listed’ left a lot of room for confusion. It never said how soon that should be – in a few weeks, months, or even years. So mutual funds stretched the meaning and began investing in unlisted companies that might go public someday. This space is what’s known as the ‘pre-IPO market’ where companies privately sell shares to large institutional investors before the IPO opens. These aren’t public trades but negotiated placements meant to give companies a capital cushion and investors an early entry. (And it’s different from the grey market, where traders informally buy and sell IPO shares before listing.) It wasn’t exactly against the rules, sure, but it definitely bent the spirit of them. By doing this, mutual funds got early access to shares, often at preferential prices, and a front row seat to the listing-day “pop”. But the SEBI now wants to shut that door . Or at least, that’s what the latest reports suggest. Last week, SEBI reportedly wrote to the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) clarifying that mutual funds cannot participate in pre-IPO placements. If they want IPO exposure, they’ll have to invest like everyone else — either as anchor investors (a day before the IPO opens) or through the public issue itself. And the logic is simple. Mutual funds shouldn’t be stuck holding unlisted shares if an IPO gets delayed or scrapped. Because that would break two core promises the product is built on. 1. Daily liquidity i.e. investors can redeem their money anytime. 2. Transparent pricing i.e. every holding in the fund is valued daily using real market data. Unlisted shares offer neither, which means they don’t belong in mutual funds. Now, you could read this as a dry compliance note and move on. But it’s actually a line in the sand about what India’s biggest pool of household savings should be doing. Mutual funds manage over ₹75 lakh crore now, and when they dabble in private-market style deals, the risks scale up too. And in a year when India is gearing up for one of the world’s biggest IPO calendars, SEBI’s message is clear that public money should stay in public markets and early invitations are for investors who sign up for those risks knowingly. So, what changes now? Well, without pre-IPO access, mutual funds will lose one source of extra returns. But that doesn’t mean the hunt for higher returns stops. It migrates to alternative investment funds (AIFs) and private-equity (PE) players that can still freely invest in unlisted securities. So the risk that was sitting, in small doses, inside a regulated, disclosure-heavy, retail-friendly system now shifts to a more exclusive, risk taking vehicle. And that’s good for stability, since retail investors’ mutual fund values won’t swing with hidden “event risks.” But it also widens the gap between those who can write big cheques (like investors in AIFs and PE) and those who can’t. Companies planning to go public will feel this too. Pre-IPO rounds often doubled up as a rehearsal for valuation. They’re a way to test demand, anchor narrative, and earn a credibility stamp before hitting the market. But now, more of the price discovery stress shifts to the anchor book, where SEBI has made another tweak. It recently expanded the IPO anchor investor pool to include insurers and pension funds, who can now join mutual funds in bidding shares ahead of the IPO. The overall anchor quota in an IPO has been raised from one-third to 40% , with the extra 7% reserved for these long-term institutions. That means the same anchor pie now has more large investors around the table, and mutual funds will have to fight harder for their share of allocations. What does that do to listing day dynamics? Well, when pre-IPO mutual fund cheques disappear, some issuers (especially on the SME boards that leaned on last-mile pre-IPO capital) may find they must sweeten pricing, resize, or defer their listing plans. Others with strong anchor support might sail through. But the comforting signal of “XYZ mutual fund already in the cap table” vanishes, and the quality of the anchor list will matter more than ever. So is this good or bad for you, the SIP and the IPO investor? In the short run, it’s boring and that’s a good thing. Your NAV won’t depend on whether some company lists on time. And if you worry, this neuters fund performance. Remember the bigger structural truth of our market: domestic mutual funds already own north of 10% of NSE listed stocks. When a pool that large plays VC-style games, it’s everyone’s problem. In that sense, boring is beautiful at that scale. Will anything break? Hopefully not since the IPO machine has fresh rails: pre-IPO disclosures got tighter this year; anchor allocations were re-architected to bring in stickier capital; and the pipeline remains robust. What changes is the equilibrium since there might be a slightly lumpier set of listing outcomes as the pre-IPO rehearsal round moves offstage. It’s a nice reminder that markets don’t only need spectacular rules; they need quiet, architectural ones that keep form true to function. Mutual funds were inching, deal by deal, toward something they were never meant to be, and SEBI might have just redrew the map. The rich will still find their early seats, companies will still list, and the rest of us will still buy India Inc. one SIP or IPO at a time. So yeah, skip the noise and track two lines in the IPO in the coming months: who shows up in the anchor list, and how IPOs are priced versus planned.

https://finshots.in/archive/rbls-ticket-to-the-big-leagues,2025-10-27,Business,RBL’s ticket to the big leagues,"27 October 2025 • Business RBL’s ticket to the big leagues In today’s Finshots, we explore why Dubai’s Emirates NBD is placing a $3 billion bet on RBL Bank. But before we begin, here's a quick note from our co-founder: ""When we started Finshots, our aim was to make finance simple and accessible for everyone.

So if you haven't already, go get your free, personalized insurance advice by clicking here . Now, onto today's story... The Story A decade ago, few would’ve pegged RBL Bank as a serious contender in India’s cutthroat banking scene – whether as an investor or a customer. It didn’t have the size, brand muscle, or deep branch network of the industry’s big guns. But it did have hustle. Being a smaller player, it took advantage of partnerships, co-branded cards and opportunities that its counterparts left behind. Take the 2016 tie-up with Bajaj Finance to issue credit cards, for example. The partnership changed how consumers spend using EMIs, and also how NBFCs (non-banking financial companies) and banks can partner up to maximise reach and revenues. By combining Bajaj’s massive customer base with RBL’s credit and capital, the duo scaled to around 5.2 million card holders, of which 3.4 million were through Bajaj Finance alone. It was a masterstroke, and some credit card metrics even put RBL’s market share in the mid-single-digits , which was a rare feat for a bank its size. Then came microfinance. RBL expanded aggressively into rural towns and tier-2 India, onboarding millions of new customers and gaining recognition as a mid-sized retail bank. That helped it grow to a point, but things changed in November last year when the RBI cracked down on co-branded cards. New rules meant that NBFC partners could only distribute cards and not earn fees. And that fundamentally broke the RBL-Bajaj model, bringing a crucial growth chapter to a close. And RBL needed something new to continue. Because that stress wasn’t trivial. Nearly 47% of RBL’s revenues come from retail banking. The rest is split between treasury (31.5%) and corporate banking (20.8%). Meaning, retail was its core segment. Source: Tijori But it was also its biggest risk. Why, you ask? Well, retail banking is a high-volume, low-margin game, and today’s retail banking market is brutal. Every offering from deposits, mutual funds to home loans and credit cards is a battlefield where the largest banks dominate. Even foreign banks have given up on retail in India, unable to overcome regulatory walls, competitive pricing, and rising acquisition costs. So domestic players obviously struggle if they don’t have scale. And RBL has struggled. As per its Q2FY26 earnings call, net profit declined 20% year-on-year due to elevated slippages in its credit card portfolio (which accounted for nearly 70% of total slippages). For a bank with nearly half its business exposed to retail, that’s a red signal. Then there’s the unsecured lending problem. Whether it’s a smartphone or a car, customer defaults hit hard. Repossessed assets rarely match the outstanding loan, and banks often take the hit. And RBL realised it couldn’t afford to stay stuck in this loop. To challenge SBI, HDFC Bank or ICICI, it needed more than clever partnerships… it needed capital. That’s where the Emirates NBD deal comes in. The Dubai-based lender is investing $3 billion for a 60% stake in RBL Bank, making it the largest foreign direct investment in an Indian bank to date. The number alone made headlines. But it’s what this capital enables that’s more interesting. Remember that retail capital problem that RBL Bank was facing? Well, one of the reasons for it was branch fatigue. Despite operating since 1943, the bank has grown to only 563 branches countrywide. That’s not enough to compete with the big players. And with most customers parking their money in the top 5 banks, RBL couldn’t rely on organic growth alone. As the CEO put it, “We are now a mid-size bank and our aspiration is to move into the league of big banks.” That wasn’t possible without a serious infusion of funds. Apart from this, the deal could also give a boost to RBL’s capital adequacy ratio (CAR). In simple terms, this ratio tells how much capital or cushion a bank has compared to its risky assets. RBL Bank’s CAR stood at around 15.5% as of June 30, 2025 (for Common Equity Tier-I), slightly down from 16.18% in March 2024. Now, the RBI’s minimum threshold for CAR is 11.5%, so sure, RBL has some breathing room. But a 3% drop could change things quickly and put the entire bank at risk. With Emirates NBD’s capital, RBL can expand lending, tap into safer sectors like housing finance or corporate credit, and still stay well-capitalised. In other words, it can grow without gambling the house. But capital isn’t the only benefit. Emirates NBD brings experience in markets foreign to RBL, which has been a domestic bank since inception. They would open up opportunities in Egypt, UAE, Türkiye, Singapore and some European regions like the UK and Germany as well. This could create a new revenue stream from Indian businesses and NRI accounts. And since RBL essentially becomes a subsidiary post-acquisition (pending regulatory approval), it may soon operate with a more global footprint. Then there’s tech. Emirates NBD has invested over AED 1 billion on digital transformation, focusing on AI-driven credit systems, paperless onboarding, and advanced mobile banking platforms. For RBL, this means faster modernization of backend systems, improved risk analytics, and smoother integration across products. In short, RBL could leapfrog into the digital age by plugging into Emirates NBD’s tried-and-tested infrastructure. For Emirates NBD, the value is equally clear. India is one of the fastest-growing banking markets in the world, with rising credit penetration, a young population, and deep digitisation. But breaking in organically is a nightmare since regulatory hurdles, licence restrictions, and stiff competition could make it a slow grind. With this deal, they get instant access to RBL’s 15 million customers, over 560 branches, and ready-made compliance clearances. It’s a shortcut most global banks can only dream of. That said, not everyone is thrilled. RBL’s employee union has protested the takeover, calling it an “onslaught by international finance capital.” And their concern isn’t unwarranted. Earlier this year, Japanese lender SMBC took up a 24.99% stake in Yes Bank. Years earlier, Catholic Syrian Bank was taken over by Fairfax, a Canadian firm. In each case, capital came in, but so did control. And critics worry that foreign ownership in key financial institutions can dilute local accountability. Strategic decisions may soon be made in boardrooms halfway across the world. And employees fear restructuring, culture clashes, and layoffs. There’s also the regulatory angle. While the RBI has slowly relaxed foreign investment rules, it remains cautious about granting full operational control to overseas players—especially in retail banking. The final approval process for this deal will likely be watched closely, and may even become a precedent for future foreign takeovers in the sector. But for now, both sides seem to have found what they need: one gets the capital and expertise to grow, and the other gets an express entry into the Indian market. And whether this becomes a case study in smart globalization or a cautionary tale of overreach is something only time will tell. Until then… Sharing is caring.

https://finshots.in/archive/lab-grown-diamond-price-fall-crash-india-china-russia-conspiracy-happy-elephants-more,2025-10-26,Sunny Side Up,"Lab diamond conspiracy, happy elephants & more...","26 October 2025 • Sunny Side Up Lab diamond conspiracy, happy elephants & more... Hey folks! In the natural order, there are a few predators that elephants fear, but their biggest biological threat is one they can’t see or fight. Baby elephants have battled a silent and deadly enemy: the Elephant Endotheliotropic Herpesvirus (EEHV). This virus primarily strikes Asian elephants, especially young calves between one and eight years old, although there is a growing threat to African elephants too. Both species are already listed as ‘endangered’ on the IUCN Red List, making the virus an even graver concern. EEHV is a haemorrhagic disease, causing severe internal bleeding, and for calves with still-developing immune systems, survival chances are heartbreakingly slim. Just in South India alone, between 2013 and 2019, 13 young elephants lost their lives to this virus. What makes EEHV especially dangerous is how unpredictable it is. No one knows exactly what causes the virus to activate or when it will strike. The infected calves in captivity, be it in zoos and elephant camps, have about 24 to 48 hours of time before it becomes fatal. Strangely, adult elephants carry the virus too, but without any harmful effects, allowing it to quietly persist within herds. That grim pattern might finally be changing. A recent vaccine trial has brought new hope. Until now, there was no cure or preventive treatment for EEHV: only emergency care that rarely worked once symptoms began. But that didn’t stop researchers looking for a solution. A team from the University of Surrey and the UK’s Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) conducted the world’s first EEHV vaccine trial and tested it at Chester Zoo, which has lost seven calves to the virus in the past decade. They tested it on a sample of three elephants and closely monitored their progress, reaction and any changes before and after the jabs. They made the vaccine work by using non-infectious proteins from the virus, introducing them safely to an elephant’s immune system, helping it learn to recognise and fight EEHV. When the team tested it, the results were promising: it successfully triggered the production of T-cells. These cells are the immune system’s frontline defenders that attack infected cells and build long-term resistance. What’s even better is that the elephants showed no negative side effects after vaccination. That makes it the first proof-of-concept for EEHV. Currently the vaccine trials took four injections. If these early successes hold up in larger field trials, this breakthrough could protect the next generation of tuskers before the virus ever strikes and perhaps, with fewer jabs than expected. If all goes well, the next generation of calves might grow up trumpeting out of joy! Here’s a soundtrack to put you in the mood 🎵 Main Hoon Zameen by Anand Bhaskar Collective A big shoutout to our reader Akshay Naik for this great recommendation! We’ve also received a bunch of brilliant song suggestions from many of you, so keep an eye on this space. Your name might just show up here next. And yes, keep the recs coming! What caught our eye this week 👀 💎 Are countries crashing lab-grown diamond prices on purpose? Lab-grown diamond (LGD) prices have crashed like crazy! That’s not us saying it, but the World Gold Council , which reports that LGD prices have plummeted nearly 96% in wholesale prices for one-carat and two-carat stones since 2018. The reason? An immense oversupply of LGDs from India and China. And that got us thinking, “Are countries part of a conspiracy to crash LGD prices to achieve something bigger?” We know it sounds dramatic but hear us out. Look, the natural diamond supply chain has always been controlled by a handful of powerful players. Russia’s Alrosa, De Beers and Rio Tinto together account for over 60% of global diamond mining. African nations like Botswana, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola and South Africa also play a massive role, while Canada ranks as the third-largest producer by volume. These countries control the source. Meanwhile, countries like India, the UAE and Belgium dominate the polishing and trading business or the downstream part of the industry. But they don’t control diamond supply because they don’t have large natural reserves and rely on rough diamond imports, especially from Russia, to cut, polish and export finished stones. But the rise of lab-grown diamonds changed everything. Suddenly, you didn’t need diamond mines to enter the industry. You just needed labs, where small diamond slices, called a seed , is placed inside a chamber with carbon-rich gas and exposed to heat and pressure, recreating how diamonds form underground. The result? A diamond with the same sparkle and structure as a natural one. LGDs also came with a cleaner image. Producing a natural diamond usually means digging up land, moving nearly 250 tonnes of earth for just one carat and releasing close to 160 kilograms of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Mines leave behind massive pits and long-term ecological damage. But with LGDs, you skip all that environmental guilt. And for countries like India and China, already strong in diamond polishing, this was a sparkling opportunity. They had factories, skilled labour and distribution networks in place. So scaling LGD production was easy. Also, the more they produced, the cheaper it became. For the first time, they could compete in the global luxury diamond market without owning a single extra mine. Initially, it worked brilliantly. LGDs made diamonds feel accessible. People who once avoided diamond stores because of sky-high prices now walked in freely. New-age jewellery brands pushed LGDs, and soon traditional names joined them — Kalyan Jewellers through Candere, TBZ and Senco Gold & Diamonds all launched LGD collections. But then came another twist. India and China produced so much that prices crashed. LGDs were already about 30% cheaper than natural diamonds, but oversupply dragged prices even lower. And once something becomes too cheap, people start questioning its value. So buyers drifted back to natural diamonds, not for logical reasons, but emotional ones. Natural diamonds still symbolise rarity and status. They’re a classic Veblen good, where demand goes up when prices stay high, because exclusivity matters. But here’s the clever part. No matter which way customers go, brands remain in a win-win situation. For instance, if a premium brand like Kalyan chooses not to sell LGDs to maintain its luxury image, it still has Candere to serve mid-market buyers who want them. Tanishq, CaratLane and Mia don’t sell LGDs either, but Tata Group’s Trent launched Pome to tap into that exact space. So whether people choose real diamonds or lab-grown ones, the big jewellery brands win regardless. And that’s why this whole thing feels like strategic reverse psychology. Countries like India seem to have deliberately pushed LGD production to flood the market, crash prices and slowly take a bigger share of the global natural diamond trade. Sounds far-fetched, you might think, until you see what natural diamond producers are doing. Diamond-producing governments from Angola, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia, Sierra Leone and South Africa, along with industry bodies like the Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) (India’s apex body for gems and jewellery), the Antwerp World Diamond Centre (AWDC), the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) and De Beers, have recently signed the Luanda Accord, an agreement pledging 1% of annual diamond sales to promote natural diamonds. But whether there’s a real conspiracy behind all this or not, it does seem to be having an effect. In India, interest in natural diamonds is slowly picking up again, partly because people are realising how much rarer they’re becoming. But hey, maybe there’s no hidden agenda here at all. Maybe it’s just market forces doing their thing and we’re overthinking it. And maybe we just need to stop watching so many thriller films!

https://finshots.in/markets/rbi-breaks-down-the-sme-ipo-hype,2025-10-24,Markets,RBI breaks down the SME IPO hype,"24 October 2025 • Markets RBI breaks down the SME IPO hype In today’s Finshots, we take a look at RBI’s latest report on the SME (Small and Medium Enterprises) IPO hype. The Story Over the past couple of years, we’ve written a couple of stories on SME IPOs ( here and here ). And if you’ve been with us through those and kept up with the news, you’d have spotted one common link. Most of these IPOs reek of price manipulation and shady dealings. More often than not, we’ve tried to break things down and warn you about why these listings deserve extra caution. Sure, due diligence is essential for any investment, but this bunch has earned a reputation for being the bad apples in the basket. Nevertheless, what has always puzzled us is why, despite all the red flags, retail investors keep rushing into SME IPOs. Well, turns out we didn’t have to dig too deep to find the answer. Because this time the RBI just rolled up its sleeves, did all the heavy lifting, and published a detailed study about how the whole thing snowballed into a bubble. And to unpack it, let’s start by going back to a time when SME IPOs didn’t even exist. Look, SMEs have always struggled to raise money. Banks rarely trusted them because there wasn’t enough history or reliable information about their business or cash flows. Even today, about 22% of small Indian firms say lack of finance is their biggest problem. This issue goes back to India’s post-independence policies. Small-scale industries like handicrafts and village-based manufacturing were seen as engines of rural employment, so the government protected them. It even reserved hundreds of products exclusively for small firms, blocking large companies from competing. But this protection had side effects. Many of these businesses stayed tiny forever. They didn’t invest in technology or expand because they never had to face competition. And as a result, India ended up with lots of micro firms and a few large companies, but hardly any midsized ones. Something that economists called the problem of the “missing middle”. Then came economic reforms in the mid-1980s and 1990s. The country opened up, competition increased, and small businesses suddenly needed capital to grow. But banks were still unwilling to lend, and equity markets weren’t built for small players. So, the idea of a stock market platform just for SMEs began taking shape. The first attempt was the OTCEI (Over The Counter Exchange of India) in 1989. It was meant to help smaller firms raise funds, but it failed due to low investor interest. The second attempt, BSE IndoNext in 2005, also fizzled out due to similar reasons. And the real breakthrough only came in 2012 when BSE SME Exchange and NSE Emerge were launched. They relaxed rules on minimum IPO size, capital requirements, and compliance and reporting norms. And suddenly, going public became possible for SMEs. The impact was dramatic. SME IPO listings jumped from just 1 in 2012 to over 200 by 2024. And fundraising went from ₹7 crores to a whopping ₹5,900 crores! In the last year alone, SME IPO fundraising has shot up 52%. Source: RBI Report And with this rapid growth came questionable activity. SEBI began sniffing around and found irregularities. And although there isn’t official data to say how bad it was, market veteran Vijay Kedia claims that 90% of SME IPOs are manipulated. But then, how did such huge interest in SME IPOs even begin, you ask? You see, till around 2018, SME IPOs were a quiet corner of the market. The BSE SME and NSE Emerge platforms were still new, and most investors treated them like an experiment. You could say that they were a way to dabble in smaller companies outside the large-cap universe. Then came the 2019 to 2021 period, when sentiment weakened, Covid hit, and SME listings slowed down. But once the pandemic settled, the space exploded for three simple reasons. To begin with, trading became ridiculously easy. Discount broker apps and paperless IPO applications lowered the entry barrier. SME IPOs also allowed tiny application sizes, so retail investors could join the party even with small capital. Second, UPI and ASBA (Application Supported by Blocked Amount) changed the game. Investors no longer had to pay upfront. They could simply block funds in their bank accounts during IPO applications. That made applying as easy as ordering food online. Third, state governments like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan stepped in and began offering incentives like subsidies on listing costs to encourage SMEs to go public. That pulled more companies into the IPO pipeline. And then the madness began. To put things in perspective, between January and June 2023, just 7 SME IPOs were oversubscribed 100 times or more. But after July 2023, that number more than quadrupled to 32! Retail behaviour shifted too. Earlier, people bought SME IPOs out of curiosity or for diversification from mainstream sectors. But after 2023, it turned into a pure listing gain chase, thanks to news and social media hype around “multibagger IPOs”. Merchant bankers (the folks who handle due diligence, prepare documents and market the IPO) also added fuel to the fire. In mainboard IPOs, big brand names, say, LIC, Zomato or Tata group firms, do most of the selling because everyone knows them. But SME IPOs come from companies most people have never heard of. So when investors can’t judge the business, they rely on the reputation of the banker handling the IPO instead. The RBI even found that SME IPOs handled by reputed bankers had twice the subscription levels compared to others because investors simply trusted them more. But there’s another layer to this. In SME IPOs, merchant bankers must also act as market makers for three years after listing. That means the must ensure that there are always buy and sell offers so that the stock doesn’t freeze due to low trading volumes. For retail investors, that feels like a safety net. Someone is always there to keep the stock liquid, at least on paper. So in many ways, trust in SME IPOs wasn’t built on company fundamentals. The bigger thing was that more younger investors became part of the market. The median investor age dropped from 38 in 2019 to 33 in 2025. And when they saw SME IPOs doubling on listing day, with gains touching 400% in extreme cases, they rushed in. The RBI suggests that between FY24 and FY25, 87% of SME IPOs on NSE and 91% on BSE listed at a premium. Compare that to mainboard IPOs that usually deliver 10‒40% gains, and you’ll see why they didn’t stand a chance to compete against SMEs. All of this translated into applications shooting through the roof. In FY23, there were just 4 SME IPO applicants for every allottee. But by FY25, that number had exploded to 245 applicants for every single allottee! And that’s how early scepticism around SME IPOs flipped into full-blown euphoria. From struggling to raise capital, SMEs suddenly had more money chasing them than they could take. But there was one notable exception — Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) like mutual funds and insurance companies, who mostly stayed away, despite SEBI trying to pull them in. Because here’s the catch. Unlike retail investors, these institutions looked at fundamentals. And many SME IPOs were simply overvalued and unstable. When the RBI’s study tracked SME IPOs over the last two financial years and compared them with mainboard IPOs to understand this, they found a stark difference. It saw that after a month, mainboard IPO prices moved in a controlled way, while SME IPOs showed big gains for some and sharp drops for others. After 3 months, mainboard returns stayed steady but SME IPOs continued to swing wildly. And after 6 months, most mainboard IPOs were still stable, while many SME IPOs crashed below their listing price. And the worst crashes? They happened in IPOs where retail investors had applied aggressively. Basically, so many people piled in, that prices got artificially inflated. At one point, nearly 20% of SME IPOs were trading at unjustified valuations or at P/E ratios much higher than their industry peers. Naturally, all that frenzy eventually forced SEBI to step in. The regulator didn’t want retail investors blindly following the herd into risky SME IPOs. So in 2024 it quietly raised the entry barriers. The minimum application size was proposed to be doubled from ₹1 lakh to ₹2 lakh, making it harder for casual punters to treat SME IPOs like lottery tickets. It also increased the minimum number of allottees from 50 to 200 so that a small group of insiders couldn’t corner the entire issue. And to ensure that only genuine businesses made it to the market, it introduced an operating profitability filter. SMEs would now need to show at least ₹1 crore in operating profit in two of the previous three financial years before going public. In short, SEBI simply made sure that only serious investors and real companies walked through them. Even NSE came up with its own set of rules for these IPOs. So yeah, that’s what the RBI dug into. And its message is simple… Don’t get carried away by market euphoria. As the old saying goes, “Bull markets are born on pessimism, grow on scepticism, mature on optimism, and die on euphoria.” The SME IPO rush may look exciting today, but hype doesn’t last forever. And when the music stops, someone gets left holding the bag. And if you’ve read this story, the least you can do is make sure it isn’t you.

And in this week’s Markets edition, we broke down why the RBI is worried about the SME IPO frenzy, what’s fuelling it, why retail investors are flocking in and whether it’s becoming a bubble that could burst just as fast. Click here to read the full markets story. And with that out of the way, let’s take a look back at what we wrote this week. The CERC-IEX insider trading saga explained It’s not every day that an insider trading case begins inside a regulator’s office. But that’s exactly what happened when SEBI traced a series of suspicious trades in IEX stock options back to the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) — the same body that drafted the marker coupling order which crashed IEX’s stock. Turns out, officials from CERC’s economics division allegedly leaked the confidential order to friends and family before it became public. Those in the know bet against IEX by buying put options (essentially wagering that the stock would fall) and when it did, they collectively walked away with a staggering ₹173 crore in profits. It’s a rare case where the rule-maker became the rule-breaker, showing just how quickly trust in a fair market can evaporate when information stops being equal. Read our Tuesday’s story to know how the entire episode unfolded and what it means for market integrity. Can India really grow at 6.6% like the IMF says? The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently raised India’s FY26 growth forecast slightly higher from 6.4% to 6.6%. That might not sound like much, but the upgrade came despite Trump’s 50% tariffs on Indian exports. In other words, the IMF still believes India’s momentum is strong enough to cushion global shocks. But are these forecasts actually reliable? Well, we dug into IMF forecasts and noticed a pattern. The Fund’s global projections often lean optimistic, especially around crises. Yet India seems to buck that trend. Thanks to better, faster data updates and a resilient domestic economy, the IMF’s India forecasts have historically been remarkably accurate. Which again brought us back to the question - Is the 6.6% growth forecast optimism or realism? Find out the answer in our Wednesday’s newsletter here . What’s up with the new EPFO rules? The EPFO’s proposed rules promise fewer forms and faster claims… but there’s a catch. For the first time, they’ll lock away 25% of your provident fund corpus until retirement. The idea is to stop people from dipping into their savings too early. But for many employees, it feels like the state is deciding when and how they can touch their own money. The new framework merges 13 withdrawal clauses into just three: for essential needs, housing, and special circumstances. It allows access to both employer and employee contributions after just one year of service, but that final 25% stays out of reach as a so-called ‘retirement safeguard.’ The logic makes sense because Indians often retire with very little savings left. But the execution raises bigger questions about financial autonomy. If you earn it, fund it, and pay taxes on it, should you really need permission to use it? You can read our take in Thursday’s story . How reliant is the Indian pharma industry on China? India may be the world’s pharmacy, but the chemistry behind it largely comes from China. Over 70% of the raw materials that go into our drug manufacturing — known as Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and Key Starting Materials (KSMs) — are imported from Chinese factories. And for some critical compounds, that number is close to 100%. But this wasn’t always the case. India once made most of its APIs domestically, but as Chinese manufacturers scaled up with cheap power, raw materials, and integrated chemical parks, Indian plants slowly shut down. And despite India’s new bulk drug parks and ₹7,000 crore in incentives, catching up won’t be that easy.

But before we begin, if you like stories that make business and finance actually make sense, then hit subscribe by clicking here . If you’re already a subscriber (or reading this on the app), just scroll down – today's story's a good one. The Story India loves to call itself the pharmacy of the world. And that’s not without reason. We make and export generic drugs to over 200 countries. But beneath this success story lies an uncomfortable truth. That the pharmacy depends on another supplier for its raw materials. Yup, because India does make the pills, but it doesn’t make enough of the ingredients that make those pills work. Those ingredients are called APIs, or Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients, which are the core chemicals that give a drug its therapeutic effect. And to make those APIs, you need something called Key Starting Materials (KSMs) which are the high-quality raw inputs used in the earliest stages of production. So think of APIs as the cake and KSMs as the flour and butter that go into baking it. For many critical APIs or KSMs, our import dependence is 60–70% on China, and in some cases, that number is close to100%. Source: RIS | Discussion Paper 268 Now, this dependency wasn’t built overnight. It’s the result of decades of economic drift. Back in the 1980s, India produced most of its APIs domestically. But over time, environmental regulations, high energy costs, and the rise of cheaper Chinese imports made many plants simply unviable. So by the early 2000s, it was logically more profitable to focus on formulations or the so called ‘finished drugs’ than making the chemistry behind them. And that’s how Indian manufacturers quietly outsourced that part of the chain to China. And honestly, for a while, no one noticed until the pandemic hit. When Chinese factories shut down, prices of common APIs like paracetamol and azithromycin spiked overnight . The supply chain froze, production slowed, and the world’s pharmacy discovered it didn’t control its own shelves. Which brings up the question: what did we do, or are doing, to address this bottleneck? Well, the government’s response has been to roll out a ₹7,000 crore Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to rebuild domestic API capacity. And as a part of this, it approved building three Bulk Drug Parks in Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, and Himachal Pradesh – and pushed companies to restart manufacturing of certain compounds or fermentation-based antibiotics. Take, for instance, Aurobindo Pharma. They recently commissioned a ₹2,400 crore plant to produce Penicillin G – an antibiotic used to treat a wide range of bacterial infections. Similarly, several companies, such as Alkem Labs and Sun Pharma, have started producing clavulanic acid, the primary ingredient in Augmentin, another antibiotic. In just the last 2 years, since the start of the PLI scheme, we’ve had close to ₹3,000 crore worth of investments from various companies to start producing APIs and KSMs. But was this enough to cease the dependence on China? Well, not really. And let me explain why. China has been a leader in this segment for the last few decades. Which means that it has achieved economies of scale i.e. having the know-how to produce these items economically and at a large scale. But how did China get to this scale, you ask? By treating pharmaceuticals as a strategic industry as far back as the 1990s and into the 2000s. It offered cheap land, reliable utilities, low-interest loans, and export-linked tax incentives to drug manufacturers. And gradually, thousands of small and mid-sized API producers sprouted across provinces like Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shandong. However, the real turning point came when China integrated environmental compliance into its supply chains. This was when many Western countries scaled back bulk drug production due to concerns about pollution, and China filled that gap by building dedicated chemical parks with centralized waste treatment. It also built an ecosystem where KSM producers, intermediate processors, and API manufacturers operated in close proximity, so logistics costs can be slashed drastically. But China’s rise wasn’t just about policy. It was also about resources. You see, many of the ingredients used in pharmaceutical chemistry rely on certain minerals and specialty chemicals. These elements are used in everything from catalysts in fermentation to the purification of compounds. They are essential for producing high-purity APIs on a large scale. And China holds a near-monopoly on that front. It controls roughly 60–70% of global rare earth mining and has a near-monopoly on its processing. This means that apart from having cheaper access to these materials, Chinese manufacturers also have an almost guaranteed access to processed specialty chemicals and minerals . This kind of policy makes it very unstable to open a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility outside of China and to maintain continuous access to the raw ingredients needed to produce APIs at a competitive price. Apart from policy and raw material, China has another advantage: labour. As per a World Bank study , if a typical Western API company has an average wage index of 100, this index is as low as 8 for a Chinese company and 10 for an Indian company. This means that if a Western company pays its workers ₹100 for a certain amount of work, a Chinese company would only pay about ₹8, and an Indian company would pay about ₹10 for the same job. And lastly, there’s just one more advantage where China really takes the home run. And that is infrastructure. Since industrial clusters in China integrate chemicals, solvents, utilities, and waste treatment… the API plants can buy cheap steam, power, and intermediates next door. All while India’s units face higher input costs and patchy utilities despite progress in the new parks. So, there you have it: Public policy, Rare earth minerals, Labour, and Infrastructure. In a nutshell, these four factors are why China has built a thriving API manufacturing industry. You could say that they mastered the chemistry, the scale, and the economics that make the drug industry stick. India, meanwhile, mastered the branding and distribution that took it to the world. We excel at finished medicine, but at the most energy and capital-intensive stages like fermentation and key intermediates, we ceded ground decades ago. And rebuilding that lost chain takes time. It needs reliability and scale, the kind that can’t be faked with pilot runs or short-term subsidies. And it needs trust. Because global buyers, especially in the US and EU, now demand stricter traceability, cleaner production, and consistent quality – all the things that can raise costs just as Chinese suppliers discount to defend their share. Still, India has a shot worth fighting. It doesn’t need to replace China entirely. But just reduce its vulnerability by delivering on low-cost utility drugs from the bulk-drug parks we spoke of above. Plus, if big formulations sign multi-year purchase deals, and if we double down on high-import-risk APIs like antibiotics and vitamins, we could build an ecosystem where chemistry becomes as much our strength as formulations once did. Moreover, we can also prioritise fermentation and high-import-risk molecules under PLI, while encouraging domestic intermediates to cut Chinese feedstock dependence. And lastly, enforce quality and build traceability to win premium buyers. Done well, these can help de-risk the chokepoints that we face today and anchor a resilient base that lets ‘the world’s pharmacy’ stand on more of its own raw materials. And maybe that’s the real test for India’s chemical and pharma future. What do you think? Until then… Sharing is caring.

https://finshots.in/archive/whats-up-with-the-new-epfo-rules,2025-10-23,Policy,What’s up with the new EPFO rules?,"23 October 2025 • Policy What’s up with the new EPFO rules? In today’s Finshots, we tell you about the new Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation rules and the tug‑of‑war between discipline and control. But before we begin, if you like stories that make business and finance actually make sense, then hit subscribe by clicking here . If you’re already a subscriber (or reading this on the app), just scroll down – today's story's a good one. The Story There’s been a lot of hubbub around the new EPFO (Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation) withdrawal rules. Depending on where you stand, it’s either the government acting like a nanny or a long-overdue nudge toward genuine retirement discipline. But to really get what’s going on, you first need to know what the EPFO, as an idea, truly is. See, if you’re part of India’s formal workforce, a small line in your payslip binds you to the state. 12% of your basic salary (plus dearness allowance if you’re a government employee), up to a limit of ₹15,000, is sent to the EPFO, which is a 73‑year‑old behemoth managing over ₹28 lakh crore on behalf of roughly 32 crore accounts . Your employer matches that contribution. And this pooled money fund earns 8.25% interest and sits there, waiting for your future self. The premise is simple. Most people don’t save for old age voluntarily, so the system makes sure a part of their income is set aside automatically. And that logic, to be fair, is sound since India’s safety nets are weak. A few months of unemployment can derail a family's savings. So a mandatory savings plan makes sense in theory. But the latest proposed changes , marketed as “ease of living”, sting a little. Because for the first time, EPFO is drawing a line between what’s yours and what you’re allowed to touch. You see, earlier if you wanted to partially withdraw from your EPF for reasons like marriage, education, illness, buying a home, etc. you had to make a claim under any of the 13 different withdrawal clauses. And eligibility depended on how long you worked. Different reasons had different minimum service periods, sometimes up to 7 years, which led to many claim rejections. That caused a lot of confusion and delays. Besides, you could withdraw only your own contribution and interest, and that too only 50% to 100% depending on the case. Employers’ share was not allowed to be withdrawn. But now these multiple clauses have been merged into 3 broad ones — Essential Needs, Housing, and Special Circumstances, to make paperwork easier. Employees can withdraw up to 100% of their “eligible balance”, which now includes both employer and employee’s contributions plus interest. And all that sounds generous, until you read the fine print which says that at least 25% of your corpus must stay locked until retirement. You can dip into the rest after 12 months of service (instead of the earlier 5-7 year wait period). If you lose your job though, you’ll have to wait 12 months (instead of the earlier 2 months) of unemployment to withdraw the remaining amount, and 36 months for your pension (EPS) share. At first glance, that feels balanced. The Ministry of Labour argues that the earlier system was messy. The new framework, they say, simplifies things and expands access. In fact, earlier, access to the employer’s portion was limited or inconsistent across clauses; now it’s clearly included, which means the amount you can withdraw immediately (up to 75% of the corpus) is larger than before. But then comes the catch. That final 25% stays out of reach to prevent “erosion of retirement savings.” And to be fair, the logic is data‑backed. Half of EPFO members retire with less than ₹20,000 in their accounts, and nearly three-fourths withdraw pension balances within 4 years of joining – which is well before the 10-year mark that qualifies them for a lifetime pension. This is at a time when India is ageing fast , and by 2050 the number of senior citizens will have more than doubled from today's levels. So the state fears that if this continues and citizens drain their savings early, future taxpayers will eventually end up footing the bill through subsidies and welfare. Which is why policymakers have built what economists call a ‘commitment device’ or a rule that protects you from your impulsive self. But when you put yourself in an employee’s shoes, it feels less like discipline and more like being deprived of the privilege to use what’s yours. Simply because this isn’t a government handout but your salary, earned after taxes. Yet every decision about it… from how much you contribute, what interest you earn, when you can withdraw to even which assets your money is invested in — is made by someone else. The EPFO enforces the deduction, sets the rate, manages the portfolio, and can change the rules whenever it pleases. So who really owns your provident fund? And the question hits harder when you see the imbalance. Government employees enjoy flexible pensions and their own General Provident Fund. Private‑sector workers, meanwhile, are bound to EPFO, where even basic withdrawals can feel like pulling teeth. If you’ve been there, you know how the website crashes , the passbook becomes inaccessible, accounts get locked over KYC mismatches, and claims can take weeks. Sure, the new notification promises real-time settlements, a cloud-based core system, and instant claim verification — but on the ground, glitches still dominate user experience. So while the reform promises efficiency, it also quietly expands the state’s discretion. And then there’s the elephant in the room: what your money does while it’s locked away. You see, the EPFO isn’t just a savings vault but it’s one of India’s largest institutional investors. As of March 2024, its total corpus stood at ₹24.7 lakh crore , of which ₹22.4 lakh crore is in government securities and ₹2.3 lakh crore in ETFs. That’s long‑term capital that funds infrastructure and public spending. And the longer your money stays put, the longer it serves for the government as cheap, stable financing. That might make fiscal sense, but for workers, it blurs the line between saving and serving. Because imagine being unemployed. That’s exactly when you need cash the most, yeah? And yet, the rules say you can touch only 75% of your own corpus right now, and the rest after a year. Sure, supporters of the reform say this is about teaching prudence i.e. preventing people from treating PF like a recurring deposit for impulse purchases. Fair enough. But restrictions don’t automatically create trust no? If anything, they can make workers view the PF as a tax they’ll never fully get back. Many already contribute only the bare minimum and smaller firms often skirt compliance. And if formal employees start seeing the EPFO as an unresponsive custodian, the system’s very legitimacy erodes. Even the investment argument isn’t ironclad. Yes, the PF pays 8.25% today, but it’s tax-free only up to employee contributions of ₹2.5 lakh per year (₹5 lakh if there’s no employer contribution). Beyond that, interest is taxable since FY22. And when financial literacy is improving and investment options are multiplying, it’s hard to justify a system that still assumes citizens can’t be trusted with their own money. And maybe that’s the real paradox of EPFO. It’s not financial but philosophical. It’s the tension between individual freedom and institutional control. So what does this mean for you and me? Well, if you’re young, switch jobs often, or are saving for a house or education, the reduced service period and unified rules will help. But if you’re in your later years of employment, relying on your PF as a genuine safety net, that 25% lock‑in changes everything. It limits access without reducing risk. And remember, this isn’t law yet. These rules have been approved by the EPFO board (CBT) but are yet to be notified in the Gazette. They could still be revised, delayed, or clarified further before implementation. Still, the signal is unmistakable. The government wants citizens to save more, access less, and think long‑term whether they like it or not. The intent may be noble, and the design, arguably necessary. But the execution still treats the worker as a beneficiary, not an owner. Because if you earn it, fund it, and pay taxes on it — yet can’t touch it without permission, it may be called a provident fund, but it doesn’t always feel like your own, eh?

In today’s Finshots, we discuss whether the IMF’s growth projections are accurate and if India can grow at the rate it projects. But before we begin, if you’re someone who loves to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance, then hit subscribe if you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story. The Story Last week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) nudged India’s growth forecast a little higher for FY26 (April 2025 to March 2026). Its latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) — the report it publishes twice a year in April and October, with quick updates in January and July, now believes that India’s GDP will grow at 6.6% , as compared to the 6.4% it had estimated back in July. That may not sound like a massive jump, but the upgrade comes despite a big external blow or the steep 50% tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on Indian exports. Now, you’d think that kind of trade shock would dent growth expectations. But the folks at the IMF seem upbeat because India’s economy surprised everyone in the first quarter of FY26 by clocking 7.8% growth. And that kind of momentum, they say, can cushion some of the damage from weaker exports in the months ahead. Which got us thinking — how accurate are IMF growth forecasts anyway? To answer that, we dug into past editions of the WEO, compared the forecasts against actual GDP growth numbers and read other research papers, and what we found was pretty interesting. For starters, a Quartz story points out that IMF forecasts are usually quite accurate. Most of the time they’re only off by less than 1%. But there’s a catch. Their predictions tend to go wrong in the two to three years before and during economic downturns. Look at the data from 1980 to 2024 and you’ll see the pattern. Forecasts were generally on track during stable years but slipped before and during recessions. For example, during the early 1990s recession and again around the 2008–09 global financial crisis. The IMF predicted that the global economy would shrink only slightly by 0.1% in 2009. But the real damage was far worse, with global GDP actually falling by 1.3%. You can see this clearly in the chart below. A similar story repeated during Covid. The IMF’s forecasts during the pandemic were closer to reality but still a bit optimistic. It projected global growth would fall from 2.8% in 2019 to –3% in 2020. But in reality, growth slipped from 2.6% to –3.1%. Sure, that isn’t huge, but in the years before the pandemic, the IMF’s projections were up to 0.5% higher than the actual numbers. And this isn’t a one-off problem. A 2020 IMF working paper found that the IMF regularly overestimates growth. The bias is small each year, around 0.2% , but it compounds over time and becomes a full 1% after five years. All this shows one thing — the IMF tends to be optimistic quite often. And that makes you wonder if India’s upgraded growth forecast, despite the tariff hit from the US, is as reliable as it sounds. But here’s the thing. The IMF isn’t blindly optimistic. There are reasons why its forecasts often lean on the sunnier side. To begin with, it doesn’t fully account for financial stress in the economy, especially during or after a crisis. That’s because when an economy is in trouble, businesses struggle, unemployment rises and confidence falls. To deal with this, governments and central banks step in with expansionary policies. They cut interest rates, pump money into banks to keep credit flowing, buy government bonds ( quantitative easing ) or provide emergency loans to financial institutions. And that, the IMF assumes, will quickly revive growth. But in reality, recoveries take time, and the impact of these policies often shows up with a delay. So IMF forecasts end up overstating how fast growth will bounce back. Then there’s another issue. Before many crises, countries often experience a credit boom. People and businesses borrow heavily. This creates something called a credit-to-GDP gap , which basically means debt levels rise much faster than the size of the economy. And when that gap becomes too large, it signals future trouble. Growth slows, and if countries have borrowed in foreign currencies, the problem worsens because debt becomes harder to repay when their currency weakens. But the IMF doesn’t fully capture how this debt burden drags down growth, and ends up being too optimistic with its projections. But it doesn’t stop there. IMF forecasts often build in the expectation that countries will successfully carry out fiscal reforms or policy changes, especially if they’re part of IMF-supported programmes. But reforms could get delayed, watered down or blocked by politics and when that happens, growth doesn’t match expectations. And finally, optimism also shows up when data isn’t reliable. A 2024 World Bank study found that between 2010 and 2020, the IMF and World Bank got same-year GDP growth estimates wrong by around 1.3–1.5% on average. And the largest errors were in the Middle East and North Africa, where economic data is often weak or delayed. Poor statistics and lack of transparency make it harder to forecast accurately. But the study also found that even a small improvement in data quality, measured by something called Statistical Performance Indicators (SPI, formerly Statistical Capacity Index), can reduce forecast errors by nearly 0.4%. Which brings us back to the question that if the IMF’s global forecasts are often shaky, how accurate are its projections for India? Surprisingly, India seems to be an exception. You’ll see this if you plot India’s projected GDP growth against actual growth over the years starting from 1980. The difference is tiny, barely 0.01%, and that too just for a few select years. That’s so small that it’s statistically meaningless. And there are two simple reasons for this. One, the IMF updates India’s forecasts far more frequently than it does for most countries. While many economies get only two updates a year, India often triggers mid-year revisions in the WEO, because its economic data moves quickly. As we saw earlier, the IMF revised its FY26 forecast to 6.6% after India reported 7.8% growth in the first quarter. The IMF also uses high-frequency indicators for India, things like GST collections, bank credit growth and manufacturing PMI. These get fed into its models through the year, so by the end of the fiscal cycle, most of the data is already known. That leaves very little room for large forecast errors. And two, India has relatively reliable and timely GDP data for an emerging economy. Growth numbers are published every quarter with short delays and fewer changes compared to many developing countries. India even ranks among the top emerging economies in terms of data completeness if you go by its SPI. In contrast, countries in regions like Africa, Latin America and West Asia often release data late or with gaps, forcing the IMF to rely on rough estimates and outdated inputs. It’s no wonder that the projections for those regions turn out less accurate. So yeah, while the IMF may look overly optimistic at a global level, the story for India may genuinely be different. Its forecasts for India have been far more dependable. In fact, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has said India has repeatedly proven sceptics wrong with reforms like GST and the rapid rise of digital payments. Back in 2023, she even said that while growth in 90% of advanced economies would stall, Asia led by India and China, would account for half of global economic expansion. And we’ll just have to wait and see if this really holds up. Until then… Don’t forget to share this story on WhatsApp , LinkedIn , and X . How Strong Is Your Financial Plan?

https://finshots.in/archive/the-cerc-iex-insider-trading-saga-explained-sebi-interim-order,2025-10-21,Capital Markets,The CERC-IEX insider trading saga explained,"21 October 2025 • Capital Markets The CERC-IEX insider trading saga explained In today’s Finshots, we tell you how an IEX insider trading scandal managed to slip out from inside the walls of CERC, India’s power regulator and why SEBI is now circling in. But before we begin, if you’re someone who loves to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance, then hit subscribe if you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story. The Story It feels like just yesterday we wrote about market coupling , something that shook up IEX, India’s largest power exchange, and the country’s energy trading landscape. The directive came from the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC), the government body that decides how electricity is priced, who can trade it, how it flows across regions and of course, keeps the power markets fair and transparent. This order changed the single factor that made IEX one of the most profitable power exchanges in the country and sent its stock price into a freefall. And that’s also where this story begins. On July 23, 2025 , CERC ordered the implementation of market coupling by January 2026, starting with the Day-Ahead Market (DAM). If that sounds too technical, just understand that the power that discoms supply to your home is usually bought from generators like NTPC, through something called long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). These contracts lock in a fixed price for the electricity they buy. But if prices fall later, discoms still have to purchase at old, higher rates. That’s inefficient and expensive. Which is why power exchanges exist. Think of them as stock exchanges, but for electricity. Power generators and users trade here, and prices are discovered openly through bids based on demand and supply. Some trades happen for the same day, but some, just a day in advance. This is called the DAM. And India has three power exchanges: IEX, PXIL, and HPX. All offer similar trading products, but IEX had the largest market share thanks to its first-mover advantage. It launched India’s first electricity trading platform after the government opened up the sector, and higher trading activity on the platform made IEX the most influential exchange for price discovery, especially in the DAM. But CERC’s order threatened that dominance. It introduced “market coupling”, meaning bids from all power exchanges would now be centrally matched to arrive at one single market price instead of each exchange setting its own. That meant IEX would lose its leadership in price discovery, while rivals, PXIL and HPX could gain. And since DAM contributes a large chunk of IEX’s revenue, the impact was massive. Within days of the order, its stock plunged nearly 30%. But what no one knew back then was that a few insiders had already placed their bets. And the surprise wasn’t just who they were, it was where they came from — the CERC itself. Three months went by quietly and then, a few days ago, market regulator SEBI dropped a 45-page interim order that landed like a bombshell. It revealed that a trail of unusual trades and traced phone numbers led straight to one place: CERC’s own Economics Division, the very unit that drafted the market coupling order. But before telling you more about what SEBI uncovered, there’s one term you need to know: Unpublished Price Sensitive Information, or UPSI. This is insider information that, if leaked, can move a company’s stock price. In this case, the UPSI was the market coupling order itself. SEBI noted that between July 1, a day after the last CERC meeting before the market coupling order, and July 22, just a day before the announcement, this confidential information was already circulating in private circles. And the people involved weren’t random traders. They were three CERC officials and two closely connected family groups working together. The first was the Soran family cluster: Bhoovan Singh, his parents Amar Jit Singh and Amita Soran, and Amita’s sister Anita. Bhoovan was at the centre of the information chain, receiving confidential details and passing them on. Even an astrologer known as “Guruji”, a close contact of Bhoovan, was looped into the scheme and received leaked insider information, so that he could make money too. The second was the Kumar family cluster: three brothers — Narender, Virender and Sanjeev Kumar, along with Sanjeev’s wife, Bindu Sharma. Bhoovan and Narender were old family friends, and that connection tied both clusters together. They even had a joint WhatsApp group called ‘OTC’ where insider information was exchanged. And the source of this information? Yogeita Mehra, Chief of the CERC Economics Division. She knew Bhoovan from her college teaching days and, according to SEBI, began leaking confidential CERC documents from April 2024 — including internal meeting minutes, draft proposals and details about market coupling. Bhoovan then passed on this to the Kumar brothers via the WhatsApp group. Sanjeev even visited the CERC office nearly a week before the market coupling order was issued, sat next door to a confidential board meeting and watched it live on a computer — then casually shared a photo of it in the group. Not just that, he even met high-ranking CERC officials, including Yogeita Mehra and Gagan Diwan, the Deputy Chief. Then came the trades. Between July 21 and 23, all eight entities suddenly turned active in the market and began buying IEX put options. Volumes shot up to 65,000 contracts. A put option simply means you’re betting the stock will fall. And fall it did. Between July 23 and 24, IEX’s share price crashed from ₹169 to ₹132. While regular investors were left stunned, the insiders quietly walked away with ₹173 crore in profits. And between July 24 and 28, they squared off their positions and disappeared with the gains. Soon after, large sums were routed to connected entities — Jai Singh & Co. (linked to Narender Kumar), GNA Energy Pvt. Ltd. (run by Sanjeev Kumar) and JSC Infratech Pvt. Ltd. (with bank accounts operated by both Narender and Sanjeev). By July 31, NSE flagged the trades and emailed all entities asking for an explanation. And that trail eventually led SEBI to uncover what really happened. Now, someone could argue that talks of market coupling had been around for a while and that the UPSI period should have been longer. But one look at these trades tells another story. Some of those involved opened demat accounts just days before the announcement. They had never traded derivatives before. They had never even touched IEX stock in the months before. And yet, on their very first trades, they made crores. That’s not smart trading. That’s a pattern SEBI calls insider trading, especially when 91% of derivatives traders lose money. For now, SEBI’s interim order means the case is still ongoing. The entities’ bank accounts have been frozen up to the extent of the illegal profits they made, they cannot trade in the markets until further orders from SEBI, and they have about three weeks to respond and argue their case in a personal hearing. Whatever happens next, this entire episode is a reminder that when information isn’t equal, neither is the market. Entire industries can be shaken by a single regulation change. And when the rule maker turns rule breaker, no trading strategy can compete with insider access. That’s why the clean-up must start at the source. Internal compliance cannot just be a paper rule, it has to be a culture. This kind of compliance already exists in sectors like investment banking and mergers and acquisitions, where one leak can swing stock prices in seconds. Now, that doesn’t mean insider trading never happens there. No system is foolproof. But those guardrails exist for a reason — to make wrongdoing harder, riskier and easier to trace. They keep markets fair and trust intact. Public institutions need that same proactive oversight. Because this story isn’t just about ₹173 crore being made overnight. It’s also about innocent investors never being able to regain what they’ve lost, despite the accused and insiders being penalised, and about how quickly trust in a fair market can disappear.

https://finshots.in/markets/should-you-just-index-and-chill,2025-10-17,Markets,Should you just 'index and chill'?,"17 October 2025 • Markets Should you just 'index and chill'? In today’s Finshots, we take a look at active versus passive investing. That’s it. But before we begin, if you’re someone who loves to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance, then hit subscribe if you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story. The Story You’ve probably heard the fable. A blindfolded monkey throws darts at a newspaper’s stock listings and somehow beats professional fund managers in stock picking. It’s the kind of story investors love because it makes the stock market sound like a glorified casino where luck, not skill, separates winners from the rest. Over time, it’s become gospel for “passive investing”: the idea that instead of chasing alpha (returns above the market), you should just buy the index and go play cricket. But markets are rarely that simple. And to explain why, let’s flip that story on its head. Imagine a thousand monkeys, each flipping coins ten times. A few of them will inevitably call heads ten times in a row, right? “That’s luck!” we’d say, smugly. But then you notice something odd. All the winning monkeys come from the same village… and flip coins in the exact same peculiar way. Would you still call it luck? That’s the point Warren Buffett wanted to deliver in 1984. While finance professors at the time sang praises of the “efficient market hypothesis” – the idea that no one can consistently beat the market because all known information is already priced in – Buffett pointed to a ragtag group of investors who had done precisely that, year after year, by a wide mile, all using the same philosophy. But let’s park that story for a bit. Why am I talking about monkeys and misfits now? Because passive funds are booming in India. From just 1% of mutual fund assets in 2016 to 16% today, or a sixteen-fold leap. Source And somewhere between the blindfolded dart-thrower and Buffett’s coin-flipping village lies the real investing debate: is passive investing truly better than active? So let’s try to understand it. We’ll start with passive investing, because it’s beautifully counterintuitive. You do nothing, and somehow end up doing better than most people doing everything in the market. Here’s proof. Source: S&P Global And why is that? Well, if you’ve got 3 minutes, you can read this story we wrote a while back . But the short answer is that passive funds simply mirror the market and let it do its thing. And weirdly enough, that’s why they work. By doing nothing, they eliminate the biggest destroyers of wealth: human psychology. In other words, our itch to act or to tinker the process that’s better left untouched. Take a Sensex fund. It’s designed to do what Sensex does i.e. drop laggards and add top performing businesses to the list. So over time, the index quietly upgrades itself. It owns more of what’s working and less of what’s not. In that sense, it’s a built-in momentum investing machine. But that also creates its own feedback loop. As the biggest stocks get the biggest flows, they keep getting pricier. That’s what happened in the US during the tech boom. As trillions flooded into index funds, the S&P 500 got concentrated in Big Tech. It worked brilliantly, until those very names stumbled. You could still argue: “So what? Even then, drawdowns weren’t catastrophic. Passive funds save me fees. Unless an active manager beats the index by 3–5% net-net, it’s not worth the headaches.” And you’d be right. So with that outperformance benchmark in mind, let’s see whether active investing still has a leg to stand on. First, it’s important to understand that passive investing shines in efficient markets like the US where information spreads fast and prices adjust instantly. But India is a little different. Our markets are still evolving and inefficiencies exist like a small cap no one tracks, sectors the herd ignores or the disclosures that take time to penetrate. In other words, there are pockets where skill can still shine. And that’s what most active strategies bet on. They’re not trying to beat the market every single month but trying to spot these mispricings before others do. Like playing long-term themes (like India’s manufacturing push or financial inclusion) before they become index darlings. And sometimes, they win big. Especially in small and mid-cap segments, the parts of the market that are least efficient, least researched, and most chaotic. And there’s data to back this. As one study notes , over the past 5 years, both the Nifty Smallcap 100 and active small-cap funds delivered about 33% CAGR. But over 10 years, small-cap funds pulled ahead by 18% CAGR vs 14% for the index. And even if you look at rolling returns to smooth one-off bull runs, between Sep 2020 and Sep 2025, the Nifty 250 Smallcap returned 18% annually on a five-year rolling basis. 12 out of 13 small-cap active funds beat that. And 10 of them returned over 20%. That’s real outperformance. Pure impressive ‘alpha’. Also, consider this. When you buy an index, it’s not all that diversified. Take Nifty 50. It’s top-heavy, dominated by banks, IT, and Reliance. So buying the index could often mean doubling down on a handful of giants. Not exactly “owning the market”, is it? And passive isn’t as passive as it sounds. You’re still constantly choosing which index to buy. Nifty 50 vs Nifty Next 50 vs ESG… that’s decision-making in disguise. Then there’s behaviour. Many “passive” investors did panic-sell in recent crashes when they should’ve been adding or doing nothing. So, the label didn’t save them from themselves. Meanwhile, even a modest active strategy outperformance can compound brutally over time. ₹10 lakh at 10% for 10 years becomes ₹25.9 lakh. At 4% alpha, that is 14%, it becomes ₹37 lakh. That’s ₹11 lakh more in the same market but with a different process. Of course, that’s the theory. In practice, only a handful of active funds manage to beat the market consistently, and even fewer do so after accounting for fees and taxes. The rest lose to passive funds because the odds are simply stacked against them. As markets evolve, cycles change and styles go in and out of fashion. So an active fund that thrives in one decade can struggle in the next. And if investors can’t stomach short-term underperformance, they often abandon ship right before things turn. That’s why investor returns often trail fund returns. Which again brings us back to the important question. Which strategy can prove better, active or passive? Well, neither. Or rather, both. Because, you see, the smartest investors treat the debate not as a binary but as a balance. They build a “core-satellite portfolio”: a passive core that compounds steadily, surrounded by smaller active or factor-based satellites that chase alpha. The passive core provides stability, risk mitigation and discipline. While the active satellites allow conviction and flexibility. And how much you allocate to each depends on your risk appetite, belief, and temperament. For instance, for someone starting out in the markets, index investing could prove to be a great teacher with low-cost, low-fuss and one that lets you live through market cycles without panic. And for someone who knows their investing style, or has a manager whose process they can explain to a 10-year-old, it would make sense to slowly explore active exposure in staggered phases. And the real secret to good active investing may not be “picking right” funds or stocks once. It’s rather about following the right process, repeatedly. Which brings us back to Buffett’s parked story. In 1984, Buffett wrote an essay titled The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville . It was his tribute to the fifteenth anniversary of Graham and Dodd’s Security Analysis, the book that shaped his philosophy and fortune. The “coin-flipping monkeys” were his metaphor for a very real tribe who beat the market year after year across decades. They didn’t share a hometown or fancy degrees but an unusual philosophy from Graham and Dodd’s book which boils down to three deceptively simple ideas: Treat a stock like a business. Not a ticker symbol, not a trend, not a bet. A business with revenues, costs, risks, and a future you can value. Let the market be your servant, not your guide. Graham called it Mr. Market and emphasised imagining it as your erratic business partner. Some days he’s euphoric and offers to buy your shares at crazy prices. Other days he’s gloomy and offers to sell at a steep discount. Your job isn’t to match his mood, but to make the most of his mood swings. Always demand a margin of safety. In other words, leave room for error in the price by paying say 60 cents for a dollar worth of business. All the investors in that pack from Walter Schloss, Bill Ruane, and Tom Knapp followed the same philosophy. And to see how powerful it proved to be, look no further than Tom Knapp, and his firm Tweedy, Browne partners. Knapp wasn’t some Wall Street rockstar. He studied liberal arts, got into investing through a summer job, and eventually stumbled upon Graham’s work and went to open his little firm called Tweedy, Browne. And all he did was scour balance sheets, bought stocks selling at throwaway prices, ignored Mr Market’s noise, and insisted on a margin of safety every single time. And by how much did he outperform the passive index doing so? Between 1968 and 1983, his fund delivered a staggering 1,661% return versus 238% for the S&P 500. Source That’s the part of active investing, people underappreciate. It’s boring, methodical, relentless, yes, but that same process takes out human intervention out of the play just like passive investing. Tom followed through it, and by the time most investors were still chasing hot tips, he had already packed his bags and bought a beach house. So yeah, if you’ve got the temperament to stomach volatility, the curiosity to dig deep, and the discipline to follow through, active investing can earn its place in your portfolio just as passive investing. One last thing. Whether you lean active or passive, your allocation towards them is an important part of the puzzle. Because even the best active strategy or the cheapest passive one can’t fix a badly balanced portfolio. Your allocation decides your risk, protects your downsides, and whether you’ll stay the course when the market slaps you in the face. Because the market will always have its monkeys and its misfits, its flukes and its fundamentals. You’ll meet both in your portfolio someday. And the trick isn’t to outsmart either but build a process that survives both. Anyways, that’s all we got about the active versus passive investing debate.

Hey folks! Let’s kick off with something you probably haven’t seen on ESPN yet: a world championship where teams walk fast through streets, not to win medals, but to pick up trash. Yeah, just thinking about it might give many Indians that bright Sunday feeling because, let’s face it, we’re fed up with trash, aren’t we? This particular sport we’re talking about is called “ Spogomi ”. It's a mashup of Sport and Gomi (the Japanese word for garbage). And here’s how the rules go… Teams grab gloves, tongs, and matching bibs. They get 60 minutes to collect litter in a defined zone, then 20 minutes to sort it. And points depend on what they pick up. Bottles and cans score higher, cigarette butts score the most, and mistakes in segregation costs penalties. Sounds absurd? Maybe. But it’s working wonderfully. You see, Spogomi traces its roots to Tokyo in 2008, when a chap named Kenichi Mamitsuka wondered if cleaning up could be as fun as football. And fifteen years later, it went global with 21 countries competing in the first Spogomi World Cup in 2023. The winner? United Kingdom. And India (yes!), with the team Chennai Super Klean , finished sixth. The latest Spogomi World Cup 2025 also saw 1,458 participants and collected about 1,770 kg of trash! Plus, the format is spreading fast — the UK, Thailand, and even Australia have hosted their own national championships this year. But the goal isn’t just motivation but action. Because let’s be honest, guilt and fines rarely clean cities. In India, we see murals, ₹500 penalties, awareness drives… and still mountains of unmanaged waste. It’s proof of how a small idea might matter in a big, messy world generating over 2 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste every year. India alone adds roughly 62 million tonnes a year, of which about 75-80% gets collected and just less than 30% is treated or recycled. It’s also not outsourcing civic work to players or volunteers. The genius rather is how it rewires perception. Once you’ve spent an hour competing to collect waste, you start noticing it everywhere. It’s behavioural science in motion — make something easy and playful, and it’s more bound to become habitual. Of course, Spogomi alone can’t fix overflowing landfills or broken recycling systems. But it’s a reminder that maybe change doesn’t always need bans or lectures. And here’s hoping someone starts one in your neighbourhood soon, and may the cleanest team win! 🙂 Here’s a soundtrack to put you in the mood 🎵 Dil-e-Nadaan by Kavita Seth You can thank our reader Ankit Yadav for this great recommendation! Now, let’s get cracking. What caught our eye this week 👀 The tyres that heal themselves 🛞 A flat tyre is the world’s most inconvenient surprise. It’s like life’s little practical joke because it often shows up when you’re farthest from help. But scientists have found a way to overcome that and make punctures irrelevant. That’s the promise behind self-healing and self-sealing tyres, and here’s how it works: manufacturers mix elastic polymers with reversible chemical bonds inside the tyre. When the tyre is punctured, these bonds break, flow into the cut, and when exposed with air, they reform and seal the gap. Michelin’s Selfseal tech uses a natural-rubber-based gel that can fix punctures up to 6 mm wide, while Continental’s ContiSeal claims it can handle 80% of everyday flats. And India’s catching on as well. JK Tyre’s Puncture Guard coats the inside of tyres with a self-sealing compound, while CEAT is experimenting with similar gels for two-wheelers. And analysts think even a small premium-car adoption could create a huge market for this tech by the decade’s end. Now, more than convenience it’s also clever timing. Because global natural rubber supply is wobbling and prices have shot up. You can read this story we recently wrote to know why. And tyres that last longer aren’t just good for drivers; they’re good for the planet too. Fewer replacements mean less rubber waste that clocks nearly 1.5 billion tyres a year worldwide. Now, don’t confuse this with airless tyres. Those ditch air entirely, no flats ever. But the trade-off is weight, cost, and a stiffer ride. And that’s why scientists turned to self-healing ones that still have air. And come to think of it, this isn’t just a product story but also a philosophy shift. We’ve spent decades designing things that break and get replaced. And these tyres hint at a future where machines quietly take care of themselves. The global self-healing materials market was about $2.5 billion recently, with aggressive growth forecasts through 2033. And if even a fraction of tyres adopt these materials, the economic and environmental upside is huge. So next time life throws a nail at your tyre, imagine it just sighing, sealing up, and rolling on, as if to say, “nice try.” Infographic 📊 📺This always happens before a market crash In this episode of Finshots TV, we delve into a critical trend in India’s stock market: Promoter Selling. Despite the Sensex trading at 80,000, insiders have sold over ₹1.5 lakh crore in 2024 alone, the highest in five years. Notable exits include major stakeholders from companies like Indus Towers, IndiGo, and the Adani Group. Simultaneously, retail investors are pouring record amounts into the market, with SIP inflows reaching ₹29,361 crore in September 2025. This influx is keeping the market buoyant, even as foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have withdrawn nearly ₹1.98 lakh crore this year. So, who’s driving the market rally? Is it the informed insiders or the optimistic retail investors? Join us as we explore the dynamics of India's stock market in this episode. Click here to check it out .

Why RBI is rewriting the liquidity rules With an IPO here and an IPO there, IPOs are literally everywhere! And that is in sharp contrast to what FPIs are doing — pulling out investments in record numbers. They’ve already pulled out over ₹1.6 lakh crore so far this year because Indian equities are looking pricey, which is why the RBI has stepped in with a clever move. It has quietly loosened borrowing rules, from higher IPO financing limits to banks funding mergers for the first time ever. But can more liquidity really keep the markets buzzing without creating new risks? Read our take in Monday’s story here . Inside the theories that won the 2025 Economics Nobel The Nobel Prize winners are out! And this year’s Economics Nobel went to Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion, and Peter Howitt — three economists who cracked the code on how innovation fuels long-term economic growth. But how did they arrive at this Nobel-winning idea? Well, they noticed something strange. For most of human history, the economy barely moved. Then suddenly, after the Industrial Revolution, everything changed. Growth became the new normal. So they dug deeper. Turns out, before the Industrial Revolution, people like blacksmiths knew how to make things but not why they did what they did. The doers and the thinkers lived in separate worlds. But when science entered the picture and theory finally met practice, innovation stopped being a happy accident. It became deliberate. That’s what set off centuries of progress, powered by creativity, technology, and a willingness to embrace change. But here’s the catch. The laureates also warn that if we don’t handle innovation’s side effects wisely, growth could flatten once again. So, what can we do to keep that from happening? Find out in Tuesday’s newsletter here . Why IndiGo’s co-founder quietly flew away India’s aviation industry has seen plenty of crash landings — Kingfisher, Jet Airways, even Air India before its rescue. But one airline not only survived the turbulence, it dominated the skies — IndiGo. With over 60% market share and record profits, it’s the undisputed king of Indian skies. But then its cofounder, Rakesh Gangwal, has been quietly selling his stake and has exited the company despite its success. Initially holding over 35%, Gangwal gradually reduced his shareholding to under 5% by mid-2025. So why did he quietly walk away? Read the full story in our Wednesday newsletter to uncover the power struggle behind India’s most successful airline. Why Ford just can’t let go of India Once upon a time, Ford changed how India drove. Its 2013 EcoSport kicked off the compact SUV craze that every carmaker now cashes in on. But while the segment thrived, Ford quietly drove off — shutting its factories, bleeding losses, and leaving behind a legacy on Indian roads. But now, there’s a twist in the tale. Ford’s holding on to its Chennai plant, and whispers suggest a possible comeback. Maybe not for Indian buyers, but for exports. So is Ford plotting a quiet return or just not ready to say goodbye? Read the full story in our Thursday newsletter to find out. Why is everyone talking about the fall of Bira 91? Bira 91 was once India’s coolest craft beer.

In today’s Finshots, we tell you why Bira 91, the brand that once ruled India’s craft beer market, is slowly fizzling out… and whether it can be revived. But before we begin, if you’re someone who loves to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance, then hit subscribe if you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story. The Story Not having any experience in a field and still managing to ace it takes serious grit. And one person who pulled this off was Ankur Jain, the founder of Bira 91. After selling his healthcare startup in New York, Jain returned to India in 2007 . Eight years later, in 2015, he launched Bira 91 (we’ll just call it Bira from hereon). But those intervening years were far from idle. They were his training ground. He realised that the Indian beer scene was dominated by Kingfisher Strong and Haywards — both heavy, bitter lagers. So, he began exploring how to shake things up. The problem? He knew nothing about the alcohol business. To fix that, he flew to Flanders, Belgium, one of the world’s beer capitals, and began brewing his own. Europe had easy access to grains, yeast, and hops, and as the BBC once noted, Jain simply couldn’t find a brewery in India “good enough” back then. So for Bira, the early batches were brewed in Belgium, bottled, and imported to India. And thanks to its smooth, flavourful taste and fun branding, it stood out immediately. The first few batches flew off the shelves, giving Jain the confidence to shift production to Indore. And just like that, India’s first “craft beer” was born. Unlike the mass-produced stuff, craft beer is brewed in small batches, with room to play around with flavours and ingredients. It’s more personal, experimental, and in Bira’s case, exactly what the Indian beer scene was missing. Bira became an instant hit with the urban crowd. Sales shot up from 1.5 lakh cases in its launch year to nearly 7 lakh by 2016. Investors soon joined the party. Japanese beer major Kirin Holdings and venture capital giant Peak XV Partners (formerly Sequoia Capital) poured in close to $450 million. By 2023, Bira had hit peak sales (of about ₹840 crores) and was crowned India’s favourite craft beer. But just a few days ago, The Economic Times reported a sobering update. Bira’s auditors had “cast significant doubt about the group’s ability to continue as a going concern”. For the uninitiated, going concern is an accounting term that basically assumes a company will keep running smoothly, without shutting shop or going bankrupt anytime soon. But in Bira’s case, that assumption now looks shaky. Because in FY24 alone, it reported a negative operating cash flow of ₹80 crores and losses worth ₹740 crore. Its short-term liabilities exceeded its short-term assets by ₹620 crore. So what went wrong, you ask? Well, if you’ve been following the news, you probably already know this. But here’s some brief context. Apparently, a simple name change threw Bira into chaos. See, Bira is the brand name. But legally, the company was called B9 Beverages Private Limited. And as the brand became a hit, investors began lapping up its unlisted shares. Soon, the company was inching dangerously close to having over 200 shareholders — the legal limit for a private firm under the Companies Act. Cross that threshold, and you automatically become a public company. So in 2023, B9 Beverages Private Limited had no choice but to convert into B9 Beverages Limited. (Now, don’t confuse this with a stock market listing. That’s a different ball game, although Bira was apparently eyeing an IPO around 2026.) But the alcohol business in India isn’t easy, and regulations make it even tougher. Here, each state treats you as a separate entity. So when Bira dropped “Private” from its name, all hell broke loose. A name change meant reapplying for every permit, licence, and label, all from scratch. The process dragged on for nearly six months, stalling sales in key markets. That hurt, especially since 40% of Bira’s sales came from just two states: Delhi and Andhra Pradesh . Coincidentally, a government change and liquor policy issues in both, made matters worse. And when consumers can’t find their favourite beer for months, they simply move on. That’s exactly what happened with Bira. Sales slipped from 9 million cases in FY23 to about 6–7 million in FY24, dragging revenues and profits down with them. And losses soared to ₹740 crore that year — even higher than its ₹660 crore in revenue, marking a 22% drop from the previous year. It even had to write off inventories worth ₹80 crore. Now, we know what you’re thinking. How could a company this big make such a rookie mistake without consulting legal experts? Honestly, we’re scratching our heads too, because there aren’t any clear answers. So it just seems as if the team did seek advice but wasn’t guided well, or maybe they simply made a hasty call. Here’s the thing though. While everyone’s blaming the name change for Bira’s downfall, a story from The Ken suggests otherwise. It argues that the cracks began to appear much earlier — right when Bira shifted its brewing operations from Belgium to India. Look, the ingredients used in Belgium such as the grain or even the water, were different from what was available in India. Naturally, the taste changed. Bira couldn’t quite maintain the same quality it first became famous for. Then came the second problem. Instead of building its own brewery or opting for contract manufacturing, Bira leased a third-party one. Sure, it gave the company more control. They could oversee production firsthand and use their own ingredients, but that control came at a cost. The company had to staff the facility with its own workers, and shifting the entire supply chain from Belgium to India took nearly two years. And even with big investors backing it, Bira didn’t seem to spend wisely. It splurged on promotions like becoming the official sponsor for ICC cricket tournaments for five years until 2023. But the thing is, the alcohol business isn’t exactly forgiving. It doesn’t let you splurge and sit back with a beer in hand. It demands hefty working capital and runs on wafer-thin margins. And once Bira opened the door to craft beer in India, competitors swooped in fast, like eagles circling fresh prey. There’s Simba, now winning global awards , Kati Patang, White Owl, White Rhino, Goa Brewing Company… the list keeps growing. And in such a crowded market, staying visible is everything. Because once you’re out of sight, you’re out of mind, and in this industry, that’s as good as being written off. Or at least, that’s what the reports seem to suggest. Over 250 employees have reportedly petitioned Bira’s board and top investors, demanding a change at the top, specifically, the removal of founder Ankur Jain from the company’s management. Their letter pointed out “corporate governance failures, lack of transparency, delayed salaries and dues, vendor payment backlogs, and the company’s deteriorating financial health.” So, can Bira bounce back? Jain certainly thinks so. In a recent post, he said the company is working to fix payment delays and supply chain troubles by raising fresh capital, assuring everyone that Bira will emerge stronger. But that won’t be easy. Just months ago, private equity giant BlackRock was reportedly in advanced talks to invest ₹500 crores in B9 Beverages through structured debt — money that would’ve helped buy out early investors like Peak XV Partners and Sofina. But after the chaos unfolded, BlackRock backed out. Now, whether or not Bira manages to raise fresh capital, one thing is pretty obvious. It needs to seriously rethink how it plans things. Because if you’ve noticed through the story, most of its troubles boil down to poor planning and weak execution — from shifting its supply chain to India, to the ill-timed name change, to how it spent its money. So maybe more than just capital, what Bira needs now is a reset. The management has to rebuild trust with employees, distributors, suppliers, and even state excise regulators. That means fixing relationships, paying dues, and bringing back a sense of stability. It might also be time for some tough decisions such as a leadership shake-up, hiring external turnaround experts, and setting up stronger governance and internal controls. That could go a long way in restoring investor and public confidence. Because that’s likely the only way Bira can re-enter its core markets, win back customers, and maybe, just maybe, reclaim its glory days. Can it? That’s something only time will tell. Until then… If this story gave you a quick taste of the troubles brewing at Bira, share it with your beer loving friends, family, or even random strangers on WhatsApp , LinkedIn , or X 🍻 Teetotallers are also okay, as long as you spread the word.

https://finshots.in/archive/why-ford-just-cant-let-go-of-india,2025-10-16,Business,Why Ford just can’t let go of India,"16 October 2025 • Business Why Ford just can’t let go of India In today’s Finshots, we explain why Ford Motor Company wants to return to India four years after its exit . But before we begin, if you’re someone who loves to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance, then hit subscribe if you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story. The Story When I look at the roads today, and hear car enthusiasts praise the brilliance of sub-four-metre SUVs, I can’t help but wonder if anyone remembers who really started this revolution. Because like every big idea, it began with one pioneer. And one of the first players to bring this model to India was Ford Motors. Their Ecosport, launched in 2013 , was among the first and most successful “compact” SUVs in the country. Before that, your choices were simple: you could either buy a hatchback, a sedan, or a full-size SUV. There was no middle ground. And that “middle ground” wasn’t an accident but policy-driven. India’s 2006 Budget introduced lower excise duty for cars shorter than 4 metres with small engines, while the 2013 Budget raised taxes on longer SUVs. And that change created the perfect opening for compact SUVs that EcoSport capitalised on. That’s mostly why, today, that once niche-segment has become India’s hottest car category. Every major carmaker now has a compact SUV in its lineup, often its best-selling model. But ironically, Ford Motor is nowhere in sight. So what happened, you ask? You see, Ford entered India in 1995 and over the next two decades poured nearly $2 billion into its local operations. It built two large manufacturing plants: one in Sanand, Gujarat, and another in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. And it even turned profitable after a few rocky years. But as the car market changed, sustaining growth became harder than simply building cars. Rising competition and shifting consumer preferences toward compact and affordable vehicles meant that even a global brand with deep pockets struggled to carve out a meaningful share. By 2021 , the numbers no longer made sense. Its market share had slipped to just 1.75% , and it had racked up more than $2 billion in cumulative losses. The math didn’t add up and so it faced a hard choice: either keep burning cash to keep the plants running or shut shop and move on. Eventually, it picked the latter, and by FY23, it completed its exit by closing its last plant and leaving behind two decades of legacy on Indian roads. It was this when many assumed the end of Ford’s story in India. Their American dream, as it turned out, stayed American. But that wasn’t quite it. Because when foreign manufacturers leave, they usually sell their assets. In Ford’s case, that meant those two massive factories. So Ford did sell the Sanand plant to Tata Motors in early 2023 : land, machinery, and workforce included. It was capable of producing 3 lakh cars a year but running well below capacity due to lesser demand. And that left the Maraimalai Nagar plant in Chennai. Everyone expected Ford would sell that too, and they nearly did. The JSW Group, fresh from acquiring a stake in MG Motor India and China’s SAIC, was in advanced talks to buy it. But in a surprise twist, Ford backed out. And that’s when the rumours began: maybe Ford wasn’t done with India after all. Because why would a carmaker hold on to an idle factory unless there were plans brewing, no? By mid-2024, those rumours gained weight. Reports suggested Ford was planning to revamp its Chennai plant to export engines to Asia and Africa. The company even signed a letter of intent with the Tamil Nadu government to restart the plant for exports. And it all sounded like a sensible strategy until a new variable entered the picture: Tariffs! Now, we know what you’re thinking. Wouldn’t Ford actually benefit from tariffs since it’s an American company? Well, yes and no. Yes, because it’s based in the US, but no, because it also means it’s affected by Washington’s ever evolving trade policies, which discourage outsourcing to low-cost destinations like India. So Ford’s executives in Michigan are now stuck deciding whether restarting production in Tamil Nadu makes financial sense under these new trade headwinds. And honestly, you can see why Ford is cautious. When it operated both Indian plants, it had a combined capacity of 4.4 lakh cars a year but used only about 25% of it. Despite being one of the world’s biggest automakers, it captured a measly share of the Indian market and lost billions. One big reason for this was its joint venture with Mahindra & Mahindra. It was meant to develop low-cost platforms for Indian buyers but it fell apart in 2020 . And when that collapsed, Ford lost its best shot at localisation and affordability. And this wasn’t a one-off problem because American automakers have long struggled in India. For instance, I remember convincing my parents to buy a Chevrolet back in 2011, confident that the brand would stick around. But just six years later, General Motors, Chevy’s parent company, also exited India in 2017 . From GM to Ford, and even Harley-Davidson in the two-wheeler space, US manufacturers have all faced the same issue here: a value-obsessed audience, razor-thin margins, and a market dominated by Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai that understand the Indian psyche. From a buyer’s point of view, that kind of uncertainty hurts. A brand’s shaky presence means limited service centres, pricier parts, and fewer third-party options. When they sense that instability, they naturally go vocal for local . Especially, when it’s a luxury, long-term purchase worth lakhs. Besides, many also point out that it wasn’t just about price sensitivity. The tax structure itself rewarded compact cars, local supplier integration was shallow, and American brands lacked the dealer and financing networks that Indian buyers rely on. Ford, however, did try to soften that blow. Even after its first exit, it retained over 90% of its service network and committed to long-term parts support, a move that kept owner trust alive. Still, walking away completely isn’t easy. Because India is no longer just another emerging market – it’s now the third-largest automobile market globally. In the first half of FY25, it exported over 25 lakh vehicles, up 14% year-on-year. What began as a small export hub and bridge between Western automakers and developing countries has turned India into the world’s fourth-largest car manufacturer. Every global brand here uses the same playbook: Hyundai ships from Chennai to 80+ countries, Kia exports from Andhra Pradesh, and Maruti Suzuki alone accounts for 42% of all car exports. So for Ford, the temptation to return is understandable. If others can turn India into a profitable export base, why can’t it? Even if it’s just to make and ship engines, their Chennai plant could serve as a gateway to global markets. And Tamil Nadu gives Ford an advantage few markets can match: a dense supplier ecosystem (Renault-Nissan, Hyundai, BMW, and scores of Tier-1 vendors) plus direct port access via Ennore and Kattupalli. It even used Chennai earlier to export the EcoSport to multiple countries (and at one point, even to the US) proving the model works. But timing matters. Ford has already committed $1 billion to an EV plant in Cologne, Germany, a bet that isn’t going as planned. Last month, it announced 1,000 job cuts there due to weak demand. So, it makes sense that Ford might look again at India, where manufacturing is still competitive and export-friendly. If it does return, it’ll need to avoid past mistakes. Turning the Chennai plant into an export-only facility could help, since that model doesn’t rely on domestic sales. And success could very well depend on three things: higher plant utilisation, more localisation, and smooth supplier payments. Because those are the same metrics driving India’s booming auto-component export market, which hit $21 billion in FY24. Plus, it will need a clear backup plan too, since tariffs and trade policies can shift overnight. So yeah, Ford’s journey in India has always been about bold beginnings, abrupt exits, and the lingering question of return. Whether it revives the Tamil Nadu plant or writes it off will depend on how well it balances trade uncertainty with India’s growing export potential. In that sense, Ford’s India story remains unfinished, not a failure, but a chapter waiting to be rewritten.

Only 6 seats remain. 👉🏽 Register for today's session here . Now, on to today’s story. The Story India’s aviation industry is often a graveyard of broken ambitions. Kingfisher went bust. Jet Airways stalled on the runway. Air India had to be rescued. And yet, amidst all the turbulence, one airline not only survived but soared. And that airline is IndiGo. With over 2,200 daily flights and more than 430 aircraft, it holds a market share of over 60% . Its parent company, InterGlobe Aviation, is valued at ₹2.2 lakh crore and clocked over ₹7,250 crore in profits in FY25, while its competition bleeds cash. If there was ever a golden goose in Indian aviation, this was it. But here’s the thing. One of its co-founders, Rakesh Gangwal, recently exited the company by selling the majority of his stake. Once holding over 35% of IndiGo, Gangwal has steadily sold down since 2022. In May 2025, he offloaded a ₹6,800 crore block. And then in August, another 3.1% for around ₹7,020 crore, bringing his total shareholding down to just under 5%. So if you look at it, his exit had been a methodical unwinding. Which begs the question: Why is Gangwal walking away? At first glance, you might think founders often cash out after a long run. But dig deeper, and you’ll find something more complicated. That at the heart of this problem lies a bitter moment between the two founders. And to understand that, let’s take it from the top. IndiGo’s success story began in 2006 with Gangwal and Rahul Bhatia at the helm. Gangwal, a former United Airlines executive with deep operational experience, handled the back end. Bhatia, who ran InterGlobe Enterprises, focused on strategy and finance. Together, they ran a tight ship: low costs, high discipline, no frills. And by the time IndiGo went public in 2015, it was already India’s largest airline. But despite their shared success, tensions began to build. Gangwal accused Bhatia of breaching corporate governance norms. He claimed that Bhatia, through his group company InterGlobe Enterprises, exercised disproportionate control over IndiGo’s affairs. He raised red flags about related-party transactions , which are business dealings between IndiGo and Bhatia-linked firms that were not subject to sufficient board scrutiny, according to Gangwal. In 2019, Gangwal raised these concerns . He also criticized the lack of independence in board appointments , suggesting that Bhatia could push through decisions without meaningful checks. This included major moves like leasing, vendor contracts, and operational tie-ups, areas where Bhatia’s influence allegedly went unchallenged. According to Gangwal, this was a risk to shareholder value. Soon, he raised these concerns with SEBI over shareholder rights, making the dispute public. And the allegations centered on financial opacity and concentrated decision-making, which he believed endangered the company’s long-term health. Unable to reconcile their differences internally, the founders eventually took their battle to the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA) in 2019. Interestingly, the arbitration was first initiated by Bhatia’s InterGlobe Enterprises, but Gangwal’s group countersued for remedies of its own. And after nearly two years of back-and-forth, the tribunal delivered its final award in September 2021, and this time, Gangwal had reason to feel vindicated. The tribunal ordered that specific ( RoFR ) clauses in IndiGo’s Articles of Association (AOA), ones that essentially gave each promoter veto power over the other’s share sale, be removed . These provisions, born from their earlier shareholders’ agreement, had effectively locked both founders into a stalemate, preventing either from diluting or monetizing holdings without the other’s consent. The arbitrators ruled that these restrictions be scrapped, paving the way for a more open and market-aligned structure. Following the order, IndiGo convened an Extraordinary General Meeting in December 2021 , at which shareholders voted to amend the AOA and formally remove those veto clauses. And with this change, both founders’ shares became freely tradable. It was a landmark reform, not just because it allowed Gangwal to sell his shares freely, but because it sent a strong message to investors: no single promoter could ever again hold the company hostage over ownership rights. Yet, even after this structural fix, Gangwal believed that deeper governance issues still lingered, from concentrated control to conflicts of interest. And that’s when he decided to step away. By February 2022, Gangwal had resigned from the board and announced his intention to gradually exit the company over the next five years. Since then, his exit has unfolded in stages. Each sale is carefully timed, often through block deals, and mostly routed through the Chinkerpoo Family Trust. The latest sale in August 2025 was executed at ₹5,808 per share (about 4% lower than the market price). But for Gangwal, it seems the decision wasn’t driven by price. It was principle. Even with IndiGo flying high, he remained unconvinced that the company’s governance structures were sufficiently reformed. For him, the core issues remained unresolved: Centralized control, Conflicts of interest, and Weak oversight. In his view, while the arbitration settled ownership disputes, it didn’t fully address the cultural and operational imbalances he had long warned about. The board was larger and more independent, yes, but true independence, he felt, was still lacking. And when you no longer believe in the pilot, it doesn’t matter how well the plane is flying. That’s what makes this exit so significant. From holding 36.6% in December 2021, he now has a little less than 5% by mid-2025. And this wasn’t triggered by poor financials or weak market positioning. It stemmed from a breakdown of trust and alignment at the top. And that’s a lesson that extends far beyond aviation. Great companies aren’t just built by profits or market share. They’re built by partnerships. And those partnerships are held together not just by equity, but by governance, transparency, and mutual respect. Gangwal’s exit may seem quiet. But it’s a reminder of how loud silence can be when it comes from the cofounder of India’s most successful airline. So, here’s the question: If building a great company requires trust, what’s left when even the founders stop believing in each other?

https://finshots.in/archive/why-rbi-is-rewriting-the-liquidity-rules,2025-10-13,Policy,Why RBI is rewriting the liquidity rules,"13 October 2025 • Policy Why RBI is rewriting the liquidity rules In today’s Finshots, we explain why the Reserve Bank of India made lending against securities easier and how it could boost liquidity in the market. But here’s a quick sidenote before we begin. Most people buy the wrong insurance. They either overspend on cover they don’t need or skip the one that really matters. So, in this week’s Insurance Masterclass series , we’ll show you how to choose wisely for both life and health insurance. Only 140 seats remaining. 👉🏽 Click here to register while seats last. Now, on to today’s story. The Story If you’ve been following the news or our stories lately, you’ve probably seen the IPO buzz everywhere. In fact, two of this year’s biggest listings opened just last week. And we’re still only in October, with more waiting in line. That does make you wonder: where will all the money to invest come from? After all, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have been pulling out. They’ve sold nearly ₹1.6 lakh crore worth of Indian equities so far this year, already surpassing the record ₹1.2 lakh crore they offloaded during the same period in 2022. And the reasons aren’t too hard to guess: rising US tariffs, the H-1B visa fee hike, and a weakening rupee. On the back of it all are valuations that have pushed Indian equities into “too expensive for now” territory. Now, the folks at the Reserve Bank know all this. They’ve been watching the liquidity tighten and the capital markets slow down. And while the recent GST 2.0 revamp was designed to boost domestic spending, the markets needed something different — a little more breathing room. So while the RBI kept the repo rate steady at 5.5% , raised its GDP growth forecast to 6.8%, and trimmed its inflation estimate down to 2.6% for FY2026 (down from 3.1%), it also slipped in a quiet but powerful move: looser rules on borrowing against securities. Here’s what changed : You can now take a loan against shares up to ₹1 crore — 5x more than before. The limit on lending against listed debt securities (like sovereign gold bonds) is gone. And the IPO financing limit has jumped from ₹10 lakh to ₹25 lakh per person. But what does all this mean, you ask? Let’s say you’re an investor with a decent-sized portfolio. You can now borrow more comfortably against your holdings. If you hold listed debt securities like SGBs (Sovereign Gold Bonds) or corporate bonds, there’s no upper limit at all. And if you’re applying for an IPO, you can now finance a larger portion of your bid. Essentially, it’s a liquidity injection without the RBI touching policy rates. But the biggest headline wasn’t even about retail investors. It was what came next. For the first time ever, the RBI opened the doors for Indian banks to finance mergers and acquisitions. That’s huge. Because until now, large Indian companies relied on NBFCs (Non-Banking Financial Companies), public and private markets, or foreign banks to fund takeovers. But once this framework is operational, it means domestic banks can finally step into a $40 billion+ mergers and acquisitions space , and that could completely reshape India’s corporate deal-making landscape. Now, here’s the catch. More liquidity sounds great, but it’s not risk-free. Every extra rupee borrowed has to be repaid. And when leverage builds up, so does vulnerability. Think margin calls, market shocks, and losses that exceed what you invested. If that’s risky for individuals, it’s even riskier for banks lending thousands of crores to a handful of big borrowers. The last thing the system needs is another “too big to fail” scenario. That’s why, back in 2016 , the RBI introduced the large borrower guidelines to discourage banks from lending to big, heavily indebted borrowers with credit limits of ₹10,000 crore or more. If these borrowers still wanted extra funds, the RBI gently nudged them toward other options, like tapping the bond or stock markets, instead of leaning on banks yet again. So, why change the rules now? Look, when foreign capital flies out and domestic investors don’t have enough to make up for it, trading volumes drop. The Jane Street saga taught us that. It showed just how much of our market volume was driven by foreign firms. And if retail investors don’t have enough to invest in listed shares, you can imagine what that means for IPO activity. That’s why the RBI is taking a calibrated approach. The old guidelines will be withdrawn by April 2026 . This gives banks time to strengthen risk models, update compliance systems, and prepare for higher exposure. In other words, the central bank isn’t opening the floodgates. It’s just turning the tap on, slowly. The idea is to bring confidence back. When foreign capital retreats, domestic liquidity has to step up or the market risks running dry. And with IPOs booming and corporate activity picking up, that liquidity becomes even more crucial. So, by freeing up lending rules, the RBI is effectively trying to do two things at once: keep growth running by pumping money into the system, and keep risk in check. It’s a balancing act. If it works, this could deepen India’s capital markets, revive M&A activity, and make credit more accessible — all without cutting rates. But there’s a bigger picture here. The Trump-era tariff talk is back on the table, and that could hit India’s export engine in the second half. GST 2.0 will certainly help by streamlining compliance, freeing up working capital, and supporting domestic demand. But it’s not enough to offset the impact of tariffs. And even the RBI Governor, Sanjay Malhotra, believes as much. That’s where the RBI’s liquidity push matters. Think of GST as the demand-side boost and the RBI’s easing as the supply-side counterpart. One fuels spending, the other fuels credit. Together, they’re not trying to make India immune to global shocks — just resilient enough to keep the growth engine humming. But this isn’t a reckless easing spree. The RBI has paired the relaxation with guardrails: phased implementation timelines, draft consultations, and tighter supervisory oversight. It’s letting liquidity flow, but through well-monitored channels. The goal isn’t just to make money cheaper, but to make it move more efficiently across banks, corporates, and households — and to do it without shaking the foundations of financial stability. If it works as intended, these measures could deepen India’s capital markets, revive corporate financing activity, and make borrowing easier for everyone — from investors to industrialists — all while keeping systemic safety front and centre. Whether this sparks a wave of new lending or just a short-term liquidity rush depends on how banks respond. But one thing’s clear: liquidity is back on the table.

Hey folks! Here’s a serious question for you. How many Fundamental Rights are listed in the Indian Constitution, and what are they? We’re guessing you know the answer, but saying them all out loud might not come as easily. So, here’s a quick refresher. There are six Fundamental Rights — the Right to Equality, Right to Freedom, Right against Exploitation, Right to Freedom of Religion, Cultural and Educational Rights, and the Right to Constitutional Remedies. Now, you’re probably wondering, “Why on earth is a Sunny Side Up edition that’s supposed to be fun, suddenly sounding like a Civics class?” Well, because a few days ago, the Punjab and Haryana High Court decided to add another right to this list — the Right to a Legible Medical Prescription. Yup, you read that right. And if you’ve ever been treated by an Indian doctor, you know exactly what we’re talking about. More often than not, the prescription you walk out with looks nothing short of a mysterious code. It could have a combination of scribbles, loops, or random shapes that only the doctor seems to understand. And trying to make sense of it, is a whole problem in itself. A study by The National Medical Journal of India found that 20–40% of prescriptions written by Indian doctors are illegible. Sure, it varies across regions and doctors. But let’s be honest. We’ve all stared at one of those indecipherable pieces of paper at least once in our lives. It might sound funny, but the courts didn’t think so. The Punjab and Haryana High Court ruled that a legible prescription is a Fundamental Right, because it can literally mean the difference between life and death. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has even advised doctors to write in block letters for clarity. That’s because an illegible prescription could prove to be deadly for a patient. Pharmacists might misread one drug for another, and while experience helps them guess based on a patient’s health condition and medical history, it’s not foolproof. Take this for example. Azidothymidine , a drug used to prevent HIV, could easily be mistaken for Azathioprine, a powerful immunosuppressant, if the handwriting’s unclear. And that tiny error could have severe consequences. But here’s the catch. As the president of the IMA told the BBC, it’s easier said than done. Private doctors who see a handful of patients a day can take the time to write neatly. But government doctors who handle hundreds daily? Not so much. That’s where electronic prescriptions come in. More hospitals and clinics, especially in cities, are switching to digital systems where doctors type prescriptions into computers or tablets. It ensures that no pharmacist has to play guessing games with a patient’s health. And slowly, even smaller clinics are catching on. And hopefully, this small but significant change will go a long way, because when it comes to medication, a single misread word or dose can change everything. Who would’ve thought that doctors’ bad handwriting, something we’ve joked about for years, would one day stir a court’s conscience and turn into such a serious, and much-needed order? Here’s a soundtrack to put you in the mood 🎵 Burning Till I Fall by Framed In Crimson You can thank our reader Sakshi Srivastava for this great recommendation! Now, let’s get cracking. What caught our eye this week 👀 🍄 The rare mushroom that rises from ashes Every spring, when the snow melts and the forests of Himachal and Kashmir begin to breathe again, small groups of villagers set out on an unusual treasure hunt. They walk through charred slopes and damp soil, scanning for wrinkled, honeycombed caps pushing through the ash. What they’re searching for isn’t gold or truffles, but it’s gucchi or morel , a wild mushroom so rare that it now sells for up to ₹40,000 a kilo when dried. And its demand is picking up in India because of rising interest from restaurants and chefs who’re using it as a native luxury ingredient. But before you imagine fortunes being made, here’s the thing. It takes about 6 to 10 kilos of fresh gucchi to make one kilo of the dried kind. Most foragers sell their haul to middlemen for barely ₹10,000 –₹12,000 a kilo, and by the time it’s cleaned, sun-dried, and packaged for export, the same batch fetches triple that amount in fancy stores. What makes gucchi even more extraordinary is that it refuses to be farmed. Scientists have tried, but it only grows in the wild. Usually after snowfall or, oddly enough, a forest fire. Because when a patch of land burns, the nutrients released in the soil create just the right stress for gucchi to sprout. Part of its popularity also comes from its health halo, since they’re said to be rich in vitamins B2 and B3, packed with antioxidants, and often linked to better brain and heart health. Add to that its deep, earthy flavour that enhances risottos and pulaos alike, and you can see why it’s becoming a gourmet darling. India’s gucchi economy now runs into crores each season, with trade and exports mainly headed to Europe and the US . The government of J&K, meanwhile, is pushing for a Geographical Indication or GI tag for “Doda Gucchi” (morels that are native to J&K’s Doda district) to protect its Himalayan identity and ensure fairer prices for foragers. And startups in Uttarakhand are even experimenting with semi-wild cultivation. China, meanwhile, has already cracked commercial cultivation by growing morels across thousands of hectares using nutrient-rich soil bags. And if that tech takes root here, gucchi’s wild romance might finally meet its farmed twin. But here’s the thing. This is also a classic mountain story, where the people who climb the hardest paths often earn the least from them. And climate change from unpredictable weather and high temperatures is impacting their availability as well as disrupting the livelihoods of the mushroom pickers. The yield has been low and production has shrunk from 2,000 quintals in 1991 to around 45 quintals in 2021. Still, there’s something poetic about a mushroom that chooses to grow only under certain conditions. In a world obsessed with instant growth and perfect control, it’s a quiet reminder that beauty sometimes comes from what survives in nature, not what avoids it. And if you’re intrigued, here’s a recipe of these mushrooms to check out: Kashmiri Gucchi - Morel Mushroom Curry by Food for the Soul . Infographic 📊 📺Why more money doesn't mean more wealth India’s middle class is stuck in a “wealth trap” despite earning more than ever. A software engineer earning ₹20 lakhs annually has a negative net worth of ₹3 lakhs, while his father, a retired bank clerk earning ₹6 lakhs a year, has a net worth of ₹2 crores. How does this happen? From rising salaries to skyrocketing expenses, debt-fueled lifestyles, and systemic barriers like inflation and taxation, the middle class is facing a growing gap between income and wealth. So, in this episode of Finshots TV, we dive into the history of India’s economic policies, how easy credit and rising costs have created this trap, and why wealth isn’t staying in the family.

That’s when he begins to question what the real purpose of his plant actually is. And in the process, he uncovers something surprisingly simple — that the ultimate goal of any business isn’t to cut costs, boost efficiency, or expand headcount, but to make money.

Also, before we dive in, here's a quick sidenote: 0% GST on insurance is good news. Life and health policies are now more affordable but... knowing how to choose the right one still matters more than ever.

Only 230 seats remaining. 👉🏽 Register here for the sessions on October 15th and 16th. And with that out of the way, let’s look back at what we wrote this week. Why UK manufacturing couldn’t afford a JLR on crutches When a cyberattack shut down Jaguar Land Rover’s production lines, it didn’t just stall car deliveries but shook up an entire supply chain that fuels Britain’s manufacturing backbone. That outage, for a sector already struggling with productivity and inflation, was a harsh reminder of its digital vulnerabilities. It exposed just how fragile the UK’s manufacturing backbone really is. But the real question is whether this was a one-off disruption or a sign of deeper structural weakness. Because JLR isn’t just any automaker. It’s the flagship of Britain’s industrial identity. So we talked about what this all says about the country’s manufacturing ambitions and why cybersecurity is now just as important as the assembly line in our Monday’s story . The LG Electronics India IPO LG Electronics India geared up for one of the biggest Indian IPOs this week. And this time, it’s not a tech startup but an old-school electronics giant. That alone makes it interesting, since it’s a rare crossover between consumer nostalgia and capital markets ambition. It could redefine how global consumer brands approach India’s capital markets. After all, we’re talking about a household name testing investor appetite in a category dominated by homegrown players. So in our Tuesday newsletter , we broke down why LG is going public, how it stacks up against peers like Samsung and Haier, and what this listing could mean for both consumers and investors. Understanding confidential IPOs You’ve probably seen companies announcing IPO plans months in advance. But lately, some have been going quiet. Because not every company wants the spotlight. That’s where confidential filings, a tool that lets firms test market waters without all the public scrutiny, enters the picture. The practice isn’t new globally, but it’s catching on in India as more startups look for flexible timelines and less pressure from early disclosure. For founders, it’s a way to dodge scrutiny until they’re ready to go all in, without giving out the trade secrets. But how do confidential IPOs work? Will more firms prefer them soon? And what are the downsides? That’s what we try to answer in our Wednesday’s story . Gold is cool, but what about Platinum? Gold always steals the spotlight be it in jewelry, central banks, and safe-haven portfolios. But quietly, another precious metal is making a case for itself: platinum. Unlike gold, platinum’s value isn’t just emotional or financial but industrial. From catalytic converters to hydrogen fuel cells, its applications are spreading across the green transition economy. Demand is soaring thanks to the green energy shift. But supply isn’t enough because this rare earth metal isn’t even from planet Earth! Our Thursday newsletter explores whether this metal can truly dethrone gold’s dominance and what it could mean for investors. Why the Nobel Prize in Chemistry went to Kitagawa, Robson and Yaghi Three scientists. One award. And discoveries that are redefining how we think about molecular architecture. This year’s Nobel Prize in Chemistry went to Kitagawa, Robson, and Yaghi for their pioneering work on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). These are materials that act like molecular sponges. And the trio's research is transforming how we capture carbon, purify water, and store gases. It’s chemistry with real-world consequences, not just lab theory.

Only 300 seats remaining. 👉🏽Click here to save your spot. Now, on to the story... The Story A decade ago, if you’d said the business of being an “influencer” would one day make it to the stock market, most people would’ve laughed. But Chatterbox Technologies has changed that. Better known by its brand name Chtrbox, it’s now on Dalal Street, and arguably India’s first pure-play influencer-marketing company to list. It’s proof that content has moved from hobby or pastime to industry. At its heart, Chatterbox is a matchmaker. It connects brands that want attention with people who already have it. It does this through three arms that work together: 1 - Brand Solutions, which designs and executes influencer campaigns — everything from scripting and scheduling to reporting engagement metrics, and brings about 43% of the revenues. 2 - Represent, which contributes 46% of revenues, and handles talent management, putting creators under exclusive contracts and pitching them for paid collaborations. 3 - Chtrsocial , which is the in-house ad production and social-media-management studio. In FY25, these lines together brought in roughly ₹59 crore of revenue and ₹8.8 crore of profit after tax, with margins around 15%. For a company founded in 2016 and a sector people still struggle to define, that’s tidy. But the more interesting story is the industry it represents. So let’s for a moment understand that. You can think of influencer marketing as a three-tier pipe. At the top are platforms like Instagram and YouTube where attention lives. In the middle are agencies, networks, and platforms like Chatterbox that match brand briefs to creators, price the work, and measure outcomes. At the base are brands that decide whether campaigns moved sales or sentiment and whether to spend again. And in India, this middle layer is booming. As an EY report states, the influencer-marketing market was worth about ₹900 crores in 2021 and could cross ₹3,375 crores by 2026 , or about 30% growth a year. If you’re wondering how, well, traditional advertising is losing its voice. At the same time, nearly half of India’s internet time now goes to social media platforms, and audiences have splintered across languages and niches. The efficient way to reach them is through trusted individuals who, literally and figuratively, speak their dialect. Strategies have evolved too. Big launches still follow a “waterfall” model, i.e., start with a few celebrity faces to create buzz, flood the next layer with micro-influencers for reach, and then boost the best-performing clips with paid ads. Contrast that with always-on brands in beauty, fashion, and tech that run “micro-mesh” programmes. Here, hundreds of creators with 10k–100k followers post consistent, local-language content. Prices are set by the goal, whether it’s awareness (cost-per-view), conversation (cost-per-engagement), or conversion (cost-per-acquisition/affiliate). And the compliance layer has matured. The Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) now expects clear #ad/#collab disclosures. Health promotions and finfluencers face stricter rules and fairer scrutiny than before. So what once looked like the Wild West of marketing is slowly turning into a regulated space with contracts and lawyers. And that’s where Chatterbox is riding the wave. About 50-60% of its campaigns now feature regional creators like ones who review gadgets in Tamil or demonstrate saree drapes in Gujarati. They’re cheaper, more relatable, and deliver 5-7x better return-on-spend than national celebrities. The client mix mirrors that reality. In FY25, beauty and personal care brands contributed roughly 44% of revenue, tech about 27%, and entertainment around 13%. But there’s seasonality too, as close to 60% of annual revenue lands between October and March, the festive period when ad budgets spike. In short, it runs on India’s spending calendar. If you zoom out, the same formalisation is happening globally. In the US, IZEA Worldwide (listed on NASDAQ) is a pure play that reports gross billings (money flowing through to creators) and a take rate (the slice it keeps). And the big advertising holding companies now treat creator spend as a measurable channel. They’ve been acquiring influencer agencies and folding them into their media networks. It’s a clear pattern that the “middle layer” between creators and brands is being industrialised. But hold on. A growing industry and a good business can be two very different things. And with Chatterbox, there’s a cash-flow catch most people miss. For context, nearly 97% of Chatterbox’s service cost goes straight to creators (which is 63% of total revenues). It’s a pass-through model where the company collects from brands and pays most of it to influencers. The problem is timing since brands typically pay in 60–90 days, but creators expect to be paid much sooner. And that mismatch ties up cash for Chatterbox. You can see it in the books. As of FY25, trade receivables were roughly ₹14 crore (up from ₹7 crores in FY23 and about 25% of annual revenue). The company even booked small ‘interest income’ under the MSME Act on delayed client payments, which is a polite way of saying some clients were charged late fees. Add a related-party receivable of around ₹6 crore, and you understand why liquidity matters. Plus, this is a people business, and many client wins come through senior leadership relationships. For context, the majority promoter is QYOU Media Inc., a Canada-listed content company that still owns roughly half post-issue, alongside promoter management in India. That gives Chatterbox valuable network leverage. But it also puts a spotlight on related-party hygiene as the company grows. And attrition was high at 41%, which can hurt execution if not managed. That perhaps answers the question we’ve been pondering since we started writing this story. Why does this company need an IPO? Can’t it just opt for a private equity round? After all, the IPO is about breathing space. Of the ₹42.8 crore raised , ₹11 crore went to working capital, ₹7 crore to office/studio upgrades, ₹6 crore to working capital requirements, and ₹5 crore to brand building, with the rest for general corporate padding. Put simply, we could see the listing as a way to keep the lights bright without borrowing. Which makes us ask… How do you even value a company that sells “influence”? After all, traditional profit-based ratios can mislead because most of the spend is a pass-through. So the more appropriate metrics could be operational. Like Gross Billings (the total campaign value executed) and the take-rate (net revenue ÷ billings). You can also track the mix (campaigns vs. talent retainers vs. studio), because mix drives margin. Keep an eye on client concentration (top-10 share), net revenue retention (repeatability), and the creator-payout ratio (a proxy for how much is pass-through versus value-add). Globally, influencer businesses tend to trade more like digital agencies — on EV/Revenue or EV/EBITDA rather than frothy P/E multiples — and markets reward steady take-rates and quick cash conversion over headline growth. And maybe in India’s seasonal context, simple filters could work. Like Cash Flow from Operations/PAT (or how much of accounting profit turns into cash) over a rolling year and whether the receivable cycle shortens without upsetting clients. The bigger question though? Is this industry investment worthy? It’s tempting to call influencer marketing a fad, but the economics say otherwise. Advertising money follows attention, and attention has already migrated to creators. Trust travels peer-to-peer, and it’s hard to think it’s going away. What can change, however, is how that attention is monetised. Regulators can tighten disclosure rules, platforms can alter algorithms, or new mediums can pop up overnight. In that sense, it’s a structurally rising yet tactically volatile sector. Look at this chart, for instance. While you might think social media is booming, its usage has reportedly peaked in 2022, especially by youngsters. Oh, and you can’t ignore the AI disruptions that could pop up in the years to come. Source: Financial Times So if you’re looking at Chatterbox, you’re essentially betting on the infrastructure of influence rather than the influencers themselves. That lowers individual-creator risk but doesn’t remove platform dependency. It’s also a working-capital-heavy services play, so cash discipline matters more than creativity. Yet the upside is undeniable, from first-mover scarcity, potential M&A interest from global groups, and a clean way to ride India’s creator economy. And being the first listed name in India gives Chatterbox a ‘scarcity premium’. If you want a good night’s sleep, there could be many indirect ways to ride this trend like the ad conglomerates, or even the platforms (Alphabet, Meta) where the real monetisation happens. So yeah, Chatterbox’s challenge from here could be execution. It must scale without diluting relationships, expand beyond beauty, and keep cash cycles short. The opportunity is huge, but so is the fragility. And whether the market rewards the company is another question.

But here’s a quick sidenote before we begin. Insurance just got cheaper. Since the government removed the 18% GST on insurance premiums, life and health policies now cost less. But cheaper does not always mean simpler. That’s why we’re conducting a 2-day Insurance Masterclass, where we’ll help you understand what to buy, how much cover you need, and how to avoid common mistakes. Only 300 seats remaining. 👉🏽 Click here to save your spot . Now, on to today’s story. The Story You’re probably wondering why Finshots, a newsletter that usually dives into economics, business, and finance, has suddenly decided to talk about science today. Fair question. And no, we haven’t switched genres. But we couldn’t ignore this one. Because 2025’s Nobel Prize in Chemistry isn’t just another science headline. It’s a discovery that could actually help us fight climate change. And if you’ve been reading Finshots for a while, you already know how much we occasionally love talking about climate change. And since we haven’t written about it in a long long time, we figured this was the perfect story to make a comeback. So this year’s Nobel Prize in Chemistry went to three brilliant scientists — Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson, and Omar M. Yaghi, for developing something called metal-organic frameworks or MOFs. Now, if you’re wondering what on earth that means, think of MOFs as tiny molecular structures with big empty spaces inside them, like a sponge at the atomic level, where gases and other chemicals can move through freely. Their discoveries might sound complex, but they mark a massive leap in chemistry. Because for decades, scientists thought that creating such intricate molecular frameworks was nearly impossible. For context, chemists have long been good at making individual molecules, or what are called zero-dimensional (0D) structures. And if that’s too complex to understand, here’s a quick chemistry basics lesson. You see, a molecular structure is basically the arrangement of atoms in a molecule — how they’re connected and how they sit in space. Think of a molecule as a small construction made of balls and sticks. The balls are the atoms like carbon, hydrogen, or oxygen. And the sticks are the chemical bonds that connect those atoms. For example, a water molecule (H₂O) has one oxygen atom bonded to two hydrogen atoms, arranged in a V-shape. And a carbon dioxide molecule (CO₂) has one carbon atom in the middle and two oxygens on opposite sides in a straight-line structure. These molecular structures are super important in chemistry because the shape and arrangement of atoms decide what the molecule can do. Like how it reacts, what it smells like, whether it’s solid or liquid, and so on. Now, coming back to 0D structures, these are single compounds that don’t extend in any direction, like a single molecule of water or methane. And scientists had figured out how to design almost any molecule they wanted by combining atoms, just like Lego blocks, to make medicines, plastics, or dyes. But when it came to making bigger, repeating structures that extended in two or three dimensions — say, forming a flat surface like a sheet of paper or a 3D structure like a crystal or solid block, things got tricky. Sure, scientists could make them, but they couldn’t really control how they formed. Even predicting what these structures would look like was a nightmare. You could know exactly what elements were in a compound, but not how those atoms would arrange themselves into a crystal. So, even understanding how simple crystals like salt or quartz would form wasn’t easy. Another seemingly impossible task back then was to make porous materials or solids with tiny holes or spaces inside, that could trap or hold smaller molecules, like gases. This would be incredibly useful for filtering materials or storing gases. Scientists already knew that naturally porous minerals called ‘zeolites’ could trap small molecules and were used in detergents, fuel refining, and gas separation. So, if chemists could design similar materials from scratch, it would be a huge breakthrough. But to make such materials, you’d need to design a 3D structure that’s not only well-organised but also has large, stable cavities similar to a sponge but at the molecular level — one that could hold small molecules. But like we mentioned earlier, that was something scientists couldn’t wrap their heads around for the longest time. There were old examples that hinted such materials could exist. One was Prussian blue, a blue pigment that’s been around since the 18th century. At the time, no one knew its structure. But later, scientists realised that it had a repeating 3D framework, similar to today’s MOFs. What made it special was that it had tiny empty spaces inside that could hold small things like water molecules. This was a big clue for chemists. It showed that materials with tiny holes, called porous materials, could exist naturally. And that got them thinking. “If nature could make something like this by chance, maybe we could design similar materials on purpose?” Ones that could be customised to hold specific molecules inside them. And so entered the heroes of our story — this year’s Chemistry Nobel Laureates. Let’s start with Richard Robson. Back in 1974 , Robson, a professor at the University of Melbourne, was helping his students build molecular models using wooden balls for atoms and sticks for bonds. Each ball had holes drilled into it, showing how atoms connect in specific ways. While using these models, Robson realised that the position of the holes carried all the information about how molecules form and fit together. That made him wonder, “What if I could use the natural bonding habits of atoms to design entirely new structures?” A decade later, he put that idea to the test. And to his surprise, the materials he created organised themselves into perfect, repeating 3D frameworks, just like crystals, but with lots of empty spaces inside. These spaces could trap and hold other molecules — something no one had done before. Soon after, Susumu Kitagawa and Omar Yaghi took this idea further. Kitagawa made frameworks that could hold small gas molecules, like methane or oxygen, or even “breathe” by expanding and contracting as gases entered and left. Yaghi made a structure called MOF-5, which had an enormous internal surface area — about ten times larger than most materials. Imagine one gram of material with as much surface as a football field inside it! Yup, that’s a lot like Hermione Granger’s handbag in the Harry Potter novels. It could store large amounts of gases, filter molecules, and stay stable even under harsh conditions. From there, the field exploded. Scientists all over the world began designing hundreds of new MOFs. They built ones that could store hydrogen for clean energy, capture carbon dioxide to fight climate change or separate rare-earth materials from wastewater. Some could remove toxic forever chemicals from water or store drugs for slow, targeted release in the body. Yaghi’s team even managed to pull water out of desert air in Arizona. At night, their special MOF material soaked up tiny amounts of water vapour from the air. During the day, the material warmed up and released the water, which they could then collect and use. But it’s not just scientists in university labs who are experimenting with MOFs anymore. Big corporations and ambitious start-ups have jumped in too, racing to turn this scientific wonder into commercial reality. They’re working on scaling up production and cutting costs so that MOFs can be made in bulk — cheaper, faster, and without losing quality. And here’s another good thing. MOFs can be recycled. You can literally clean out their tiny pores and reuse them again, making them both eco-friendly and economically smart. And if you look at it from the economic lens, the global MOF market is already worth around $840 million and is expected to triple in the next decade. That’s a big deal, not just for the economy but for the environment too. Even India’s oil and gas sector is showing interest, using MOFs for energy storage and separation. But there’s another reason MOFs could matter deeply to India. The country has pledged to restore 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030. It’s part of the goal to achieve what’s called Land Degradation Neutrality. Again, for context, drylands are regions where there isn’t enough rainfall to balance out how much water evaporates. When these already dry areas begin to lose fertility and vegetation, it leads to desertification. Across the world, drylands are being degraded due to over-farming, overgrazing, deforestation, poor irrigation, and rising temperatures. And in India, the problem is particularly severe. Much of the country’s drylands face low rainfall, frequent droughts, and scorching heatwaves. In fact, over half of India’s crop area falls under dryland farming. So, the idea of using MOFs to pull water straight out of dry desert air isn’t just fascinating. It could be transformative. Sure, the MOF space is still evolving. But without the work of these three Nobel Laureates, we might never have imagined ideas like these in the first place. Kitagawa, in particular, believed in something beautifully simple: to find “the usefulness of useless”. As a student, he was inspired by Nobel laureate Hideki Yukawa, who once quoted the ancient Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi: We must question what we believe to be useful. Even if something does not bring immediate benefit, it may still turn out to be valuable. And that’s exactly what happened. Kitagawa, Robson, and Yaghi turned what once seemed impossible, into something that might just help save the planet. Until next time… If this story helped you understand both the science and economics of MOFs, help your friends, family, or even strangers understand it too by sharing it on WhatsApp , LinkedIn , or X .

In today’s Finshots, we tell you about the hidden business of tempered glass and why India might finally have a shot at turning it into a serious industry. But just a heads up before we dive in. The Urban Company IPO opens today, and we actually wrote a explainer story about it yesterday. But thanks to a tech glitch the email never reached you. No worries though, you can catch the full story here .

We're offering 10 exclusive passes for Finshots readers! Secure your spot today. 🎟️ And with that out of the way, let's get onto today’s story, shall we? The Story The tale begins around 1660 with “ Prince Rupert’s drops ”. These teardrop-shaped glass beads, made by dripping molten glass into cold water, were oddities of their time. The fat end could take hammer blows without shattering. But if you so much as nicked the thin tail, the whole thing exploded into dust. Nobody knew why they behaved that way, but they hinted at something extraordinary — cool glass fast enough, and you could trap invisible stresses inside it that made it absurdly strong and shockingly fragile. Centuries later, those experiments found a new life. When Apple was designing the first iPhone, Steve Jobs hated the plastic screens. So he went to Corning , the glassmaker that had once experimented with “chemically strengthened glass” and then shelved it. Apple pushed them to revive it. And out came Gorilla Glass we know today. Suddenly, tempered glass wasn’t just a curiosity — it became the invisible window of the digital age. Now, if you’ve read this far, you’re probably wondering — how is tempered glass actually made today? Well, the key step is chemical strengthening. Dipping the glass in molten potassium salt replaces smaller sodium ions with larger potassium ones at the surface. That creates compressive stress and makes the glass resistant to cracks. Add coatings and adhesives, and you get protectors that can last almost like Gorilla Glass itself. But if done poorly, you get soda-lime knockoffs that chip and peel in weeks. Source: ICEA So yeah, the science behind it is elegant. But the business of tempered glass in India is not so much. In fact, it barely exists. “Wait, then what’s that screen protector on my phone?”, you ask. Well, odds are it was imported or pushed through the grey market. As the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) points out , India, the world’s second-largest smartphone market, will need nearly 40 crore tempered glass protectors annually by 2025, worth about ₹20,000 crores. But over 90% of this demand is met by low-cost imports, leaving the domestic industry unorganised and inconsistent in quality. That’s a massive missed opportunity. And then there’s the grey market we spoke of. On paper, India imported ₹7,300 crore worth of “glass and glassware” in FY24. But buried in customs data are small shipments under “HS codes” meant for mirrors or other glass. These parcels, sometimes worth just a few thousand rupees, aren’t declared as “screen protectors”. They’re cut in backrooms, dressed up with stickers and sold at kiosks. A 2019 customs alert even flagged that tempered glass consignments from China and Hong Kong were routinely misclassified and undervalued. It’s a neat way to dodge duties. So the government loses revenue, legitimate brands lose share, and the grey bazaar thrives. The alert added that “ similar goods are being imported from various ports and the aforesaid undervaluation is resulting into loss of revenue to the Government exchequer. ” So while the official imports of tempered glass sourced from China rose from ₹2,200 crores in January 2024 to ₹4,000 crores as of January 2025, the real number is likely far higher once you count all the misdeclared shipments. And at the end of this chain sit the kiosks. They buy these screens at ₹15–₹30 a piece, sell at ₹99–₹149, and pocket good margins. They control the installation, the upsell and the consumer’s trust. Globally though, the business looks very different. By 2024, screen protectors were a $55 billion market on track to hit $95 billion by 2030. And while tempered glass was the top growing category, it wasn’t dominated by kiosks but by organized, branded players. Just look at Belkin , an American consumer electronics company. It turned a $2 sheet into a $39.95 Apple Store service, where the real value wasn’t just the glass, but bubble-free installation jigs and Apple’s trust. In short, while India’s tempered glass story is still stuck in kiosks and grey markets, elsewhere it has already been transformed into a premium service business. Which makes you wonder, “Why isn’t India playing the same game?” Because until this year, there wasn’t even a rulebook. Those flashy “9H hardness” stickers you see on cover packaging? They come from a crude pencil test. Scratch glass with a 9H pencil (a hard grade of graphite), and if no mark appears, voilà, “9H certified!” In other words, it sounded scientific, but it meant nothing. A kiosk’s word was all you had, and grey channels were faster, cheaper, and more liquid than any formal brand. But that’s changed, thanks to the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). In March, it published “ IS 19348:2025 ”, or the world’s first dedicated standard for screen protectors. It lays down tests for optical clarity, surface stress, adhesion, edge finishing. It even demands fog-marking (the maker’s ID etched on the glass) and a license you can verify on the BIS CARE app. And supply is waking up too. Just days ago, India inaugurated its first tempered-glass factory in Noida — a ₹870-crore collaboration between Optiemus and Corning under the RhinoTech brand. Sure it’s not the whole mountain — tens of millions of pieces a year by FY27 against outgrowing demand — but it’s the first time standards and domestic capacity showed up together. But before we get too excited, there are a few heavy odds. SKU chaos is brutal. In Q2 2025 alone, India shipped nearly 4 crore phones across dozens of models, each needing unique cutouts. Miss the timing or lose even 10% in yields, and margins vanish. Working capital is another trap. In the US, retailers like Best Buy or Apple pay brands in 60–70 days. In India, kiosks deal only in cash-and-carry. Fast, liquid, and nearly impossible to dislodge. Enforcement is shaky as well. Unless “IS 19348” is backed by a Quality Control Order (QCO) at ports, uncertified imports will keep slipping through. And kiosks? They earn their fattest cut on cheap sheets. Unless certified glass pays them more and reduces complaints, they have no reason to switch. And finally, there’s consumer behaviour. Most buyers still see protectors as something to replace every couple of months or years. Convincing them to pay a premium could be an uphill task. Especially since you can’t control the scale as setting up a proper tempering line can cost ₹200–₹300 crore. For smaller players, importing and branding remains cheaper, but again, that market is already crowded. So what’s the way out? For starters, the opportunity is real and the market is too big to ignore. Add the export potential, customs duty as well as GST, and it’s a genuine billion-dollar play. But it’ll take more than one factory or one standard to unlock it. The government must enforce BIS rules at ports. Brands need to step up with warranties, recycling, and consumer education. Kiosks must be incentivized to recommend certified glass. Do that, and the transformation could look a lot like ISI marks for helmets or hallmarks for gold. Once consumers learn to trust a fog-mark, it becomes shorthand for safety. And the global playbook shows it can work. Consumers abroad already pay 20–30x the base cost when they trust the brand and installation. If India builds that same mix of trust, supply, and scale, the ₹20,000 crore could grow far beyond regional markets. So yeah, now you know the story of the glass that guards your screens. And the irony is that tempered glass is made to shatter under stress… but maybe that very fragility could be India’s strongest business opportunity yet.

Only 180 seats left — and this is your last chance to get clarity before the change. Now, onto today’s story. The Story Back in February, I was on my usual commute to work. Nothing out of the ordinary. The auto driver picked me up on time, my lunch was packed and my metro card was recharged. Everything was normal until I swiped my card at the exit gate and the charge was higher than I was used to. The BMRCL, Bengaluru’s metro authority, had hiked fares by almost 70%, and it immediately made them the most expensive metro in India. And I wasn’t the only one feeling the pinch. Almost 10 lakh riders use the metro daily to get to work, school or simply to avoid the city’s traffic. So yeah, what was once affordable and efficient had suddenly turned into an expensive routine. And for months, the public had been left wondering why their metro fares were so high. Because you see, before any sort of fare revisions are made, they need to be approved by something called a Fare Fixation Committee (FFC) , usually composed of a retired High Court judge, a few technical experts and representatives of both the central and state governments. Basically, they put their recommendations in a report on what the right fare hike should be for a metro rail system before it’s put into action. But that didn’t happen here. Instead, the fare was hiked first, then the report came out seven months later i.e., last week, just a day before a High Court hearing on the lack of transparency around such steep prices. And that’s not even the most shocking part. What’s even more shocking is what’s in the report. So what’s in it, you ask? For starters, BMRCL argued that between 2017 and 2024, its expenses had exploded. Staff salaries, energy bills, outsourcing services, repairs, maintenance — everything, they claimed, had gone up. By their math, costs ballooned to ₹613 crores in 2024, a whopping 133% jump over 2017. But here’s where the numbers stop adding up. During the same period, Bengaluru’s metro network nearly doubled in size — from 42 km to 76 km. When you spread the spending across this larger network, the story changes. On a per-kilometre basis, actual expenses rose just 39% — from ₹6.2 crore per kilometre to ₹8.6 crore. That’s a huge gap compared to the 133% hike BMRCL keeps pointing to. In other words, it looks like the metro authority only looked at the headline costs, without accounting for the fact that the system itself had grown and absorbed much of the increase. In fact, the Fare Fixation Committee (FFC) saw the same problem. And there’s another angle. Even if costs rose by 39%, ridership had surged too — from around 3 lakh daily passengers in 2017 to nearly 5 lakh in 2024, a 72% jump. In simple terms, higher revenues were covering rising costs. Despite this, BMRCL pushed for nearly double what the FFC recommended. The Committee, however, suggested a far more modest 51.5% fare hike spread out over 7.5 years, with a base fare of ₹10 — while BMRCL wanted to nudge it up to ₹21 (or from ₹60 to ₹123 if you were travelling long stretches, say 25 km). Source: Report of the First FFC for BMRCL But to be fair, you also have to cut BMRCL some slack, given the financial mess it finds itself in. Take the Shadow Cash Support (SCS) from the state government. Since a metro is essentially public transport, the state chips in to keep it running. In BMRCL’s case, this has come in the form of reimbursements for cash losses and interest-free subordinate debt — money meant to help it repay loans taken from the Government of India and other lenders. The problem? The state’s finances aren’t in the best shape. Which means this SCS lifeline may not last much longer. And if the state can’t keep up its share, the funding structure itself (usually a joint venture between state and central governments), starts to wobble. Even outside the FFC report, both the Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister have admitted that 80–87% of recent funding came from the state government, with the centre contributing the rest. And that’s not even counting the bonds and loans raised separately. So, if the state’s purse strings tighten, BMRCL has to look elsewhere for money. But where? Well, that’s where the next reason for a fare hike comes in. Right now, the BMRCL has looming loans. Over the next five years, it must repay external loans worth ₹13,106 crores, plus subordinate debt of ₹21,521 crores. With numbers that massive, borrowing more isn’t really a way out, which tells you why fare hikes matter. But then there are also the construction delays. Every time a metro project is pushed back, costs balloon and revenues are lost. Until a line is complete, it’s just a dead asset sitting on the books. A Moneycontrol report pointed out that the newly opened Yellow Line ended up costing ₹400 crores per kilometre — far above the usual ₹250 crores for an elevated line. Delays don’t just mean higher budgets; they mean missed ticket revenues and spiralling expenses too. And finally, the network problem. Bengaluru boasts the longest metro in South India. But stack it against Delhi’s, and it looks tiny. Delhi Metro has a 394 km network with 289 stations, while Bengaluru’s, just 96 km as of now (and only 77 km when the fare revision was first proposed). The extra stretch came from the recently inaugurated Yellow Line. A smaller network means fewer people to spread costs across. So even if ridership is at record highs, BMRCL still ends up squeezing more revenue out of every passenger. So what’s the real takeaway from all this? A public transport system is meant to make travel affordable, accessible, and to ease the burden of a traffic-choked city. But when the metro carries the tag of being the “most expensive” in India — with another hike already lined up for February next year, commuters could simply end up back on the roads. The FFC report projects that by 2029–30, Bengaluru’s metro could see 15.8 lakh daily riders. But that number depends on fares staying reasonable. Keep pushing them up, and you risk driving people away instead of drawing them in. Because the answer isn’t to slap on fare hikes year after year. That only weighs down commuters and defeats the very purpose of a public transport system. Sure, higher fares might give BMRCL some short-term breathing room. But if tickets get too pricey, people will stop buying them. What’s needed is a bigger rethink — restructuring BMRCL’s financial model, speeding up construction to avoid costly delays, and most importantly, learning from how other cities run their metros. The FFC, in fact, studied examples from Delhi, Chennai, Singapore and Hong Kong. These systems didn’t just depend on ticket sales. They followed transparent, formula-based fare revisions and pulled in significant money from outside sources. Think advertising, real estate development, and even event tie-ups. Bengaluru’s metro has to head in the same direction if it wants to stay sustainable and commuter friendly. Because at the end of the day, there’s no shortage of people who want to use the metro. And the last thing they should be worrying about is how much more their next ride is going to cost.

It’ll only take a minute or two: • Click here for Health Insurance • Or here for Term Insurance P.S. Your review might just make it to our policy pages. Thanks for helping us out! Now, onto today’s story. The Story Donald Trump did it again. Just as the world was stepping into the weekend, the US President signed a proclamation that slaps a $100,000 fee on new H1-B visas (from around $1,000 ). And chaos rolled in. Because H-1Bs keep US tech running, and nearly 70% go to Indians. Sensing the panic, the White House quickly clarified that the levy is a one-time fee, not annual; it hits only fresh petitions, not renewals; and there’s a vague “national interest” clause tucked into the fine print. But if anything, the clarification has raised more questions than it answered. Even for us, as we were going through these changes. So, in an attempt to understand the fundamental issue better, I imagined a debate with Mr. Trump himself… Me: So, let’s talk about this H-1B business, Mr. Trump. You argue it’s being abused. You’re not entirely wrong. There are consulting shops that game the system by filing multiple applications, benching workers, or undercutting wages. But let’s, for the sake of this debate, say that every single H-1B issued this year was “abused.” That’s still only 85,000 jobs (the cap for H1-B visas) or 0.03% in a population of 330 million Americans. Trump: Or it’s 85,000 American jobs given away! But it’s not just numbers. It’s a principle. You’re inviting foreigners when Americans need work. During recessions, during layoffs, shouldn’t citizens come first? M: Right. But H-1Bs don’t exist in a vacuum. Last year, 780,884 people applied for those 85,000 spots. So less than 11% got through. Companies clearly see demand. And look at who fills them: highly skilled software engineers, doctors, biotech researchers. These aren’t roles with a huge surplus of local candidates. T: We could train locals instead of leaning on foreigners. M: That’s a nice sentiment. But America itself was built on immigrants . Families that arrived with nothing were leading companies in two or three generations. That’s why 46% of Fortune 500 companies today were founded by immigrants or their kids. Firms like Apple, Google, and Tesla — together they generate trillions in revenue and employ millions of Americans. That’s not cultural erosion but growth. T: But wages? Don’t H-1Bs depress local salaries? M: No, Mr. Trump. You can read this piece that we put out . It proves that immigrants on H-1B visas might actually be benefitting Americans more than people think. T: …. M: And immigrants also start companies, hire locals, and pay taxes. And if the US doesn’t keep them, they build giants elsewhere. Look at TSMC in Taiwan. Its founder trained in America, but built the world’s most critical chipmaker back home. And today, the US debates going to war over Taiwan because of TSMC’s strategic importance. Imagine if it had been built in Silicon Valley. T: Fine, but the system is unfair. Indians flood the pool, and they clog up green cards. I’ve not been liking that of late. M: That’s an important nuance. But H-1Bs have no country quota. Everyone competes equally. The backlog comes later, at the green card stage. T: My voters don’t care about nuance. They see layoffs, then see foreigners with jobs. They conflate H-1Bs with illegal immigration. They want the border shut. M: Exactly. But the two are worlds apart. Illegal immigration can strain welfare and law enforcement. Legal immigration like H-1Bs brings in skilled taxpayers. That distinction gets lost in the noise. T: I’ve said it before, I actually like H-1Bs. I’ve used them at my properties. It’s a great program when done right. I just want it tightened, not scrapped. M: So why the $100,000 fee? T: Because I can. Tremendous number. Makes headlines. M: … Yeah, that may not be the healthiest conversation, but it makes a few things clear. Each side clings to its truth. Abuse exists, but so does genuine demand. Americans deserve protection, but immigrants add enormous value and they pay taxes. And instead of holding all those truths together, the debate gets flattened. And that’s what makes it so messy. Now, we’re no experts at this. And what we say today might look different a few years down the line, in a different political or economic environment. But what we can do right now is come back to the $100,000 question. And try to separate the noise from what really matters. The fine print of Trump’s order is telling. For starters, Homeland Security (DHS) has been asked to refuse petitions unless the fee is paid upfront for any new H-1B petition filed after September 21, 2025. So admission itself now hinges on proof of payment. And most crucially, agencies must rewrite how H-1Bs are prioritised and how “prevailing wages” are calculated. In fact, the Department of Labor has been directed to raise prevailing wage levels, while DHS has been told to prioritise higher-paid roles in the lottery. In other words, even if the $100,000 toll vanishes next year, the structural changes may not. Today, the lottery treats all petitions equally. But under wage-ranking, a $200,000 AI engineer has a far better shot than a $70,000 coder. And that could squeeze out thousands of IT outsourcing-linked roles, which have averaged about 65% over the past 5 years. The report counters this by saying that several tech giants have laid off thousands of American workers while simultaneously securing large batches of H-1B approvals. But the reality is more layered. Because many of those layoffs could be tied to global slowdowns, automation, and shifts to cloud or AI — work that is increasingly outsourced regardless of visa policy. You can see this in the H1-B approvals itself, where ‘new applications’ have plateaued over recent years, while a big chunk of filings are simply renewals or extensions. In those cases, employers foot the bill, but the trade off is that workers often find it harder to switch jobs and can end up earning less compared to American-counterparts doing the same job. Source: Pew Research Centre And then there’s the ambiguity of “national interest”. The US issued around 470,000 H-1B approvals over the past five years. If the government now starts reserving a chunk of those for sectors it deems strategic (say AI, semiconductors, or defense tech) it means fewer visas for everyone else. And a vague definition could also tilt the game toward companies with lobbying power rather than genuine skill shortages. Funnily enough, this is where Trump’s stance today looks very different from his fiery promises of yesterday. He once threatened to shut the program down; now he seems more interested in reshaping it. So it’s neither extreme idealism nor protectionism. It comes out as a balanced attempt to look tough while quietly keeping the door open for global talent and let the US get what it wants. Because, as we saw, anti-immigration is, in many ways, anti-America itself. And to shut the door on scalable talent is to deny its own history. As Thomas Friedman explains in the book The World is Flat , talent is the new oil and nations that harness it will thrive. Those that block it will eventually pay the price. “…in a flat world there is no such thing as an American job. There is just a job, and in more cases than ever before it will go to the best, smartest, most productive, or cheapest worker—wherever he or she resides.” Which brings us to the last bit — who pays the price here? Well, there will surely be some winners and losers in the short run. For Indian IT giants, the calculus may shift: why pay $100,000 per entry-level engineer onsite when you can expand delivery centres in India? And fresh Indian grads with US job offers could be the first casualties. The winners could be US universities, because scarcity of visas may drive more students to pay for a degree in hopes of improving their odds later. And offshore global capability centres (GCCs) in India may benefit too. Over 1,800 multinationals already run GCCs here, many tied to US firms. So if US companies balk at the $100k fee, that number could climb rapidly. In the meantime, you need to keep an eye on three dials: One, how the entry levels by the US immigration gets defined; two, how wage-ranking reshapes the lottery; and three, whether courts ultimately uphold Washington’s authority to price-gate a visa program at scale. In the long scheme of things, though, top talent will make the cut. Marginal onsite roles in the US could quietly vanish. And that, ironically, could be a silver lining for India. If the pipeline of fresh grads heading west slows, more of it gets retained at home before it’s lured away by offers somewhere else. That means deeper domestic markets, more Indian IT companies deploying capital onshore rather than relying on wage arbitrage, and a slowdown in the aspirational US shift. For big Indian IT houses, the blow won’t be crippling since they have already been investing heavily in US local hiring. And this simply accelerates that strategy, and makes India’s pitch to capture more of global R&D and product engineering from home. There’s also a legal and political undercurrent worth noting. Industry groups and law firms are already lining up challenges, and litigation may come. If courts issue an injunction, the shock may be blunted. If not, the fee becomes a standing constraint. But here’s the problem: lawsuits take time. Businesses don’t. They’ll budget for the worst-case and adjust hiring today. And that timeline friction — when rules are uncertain but hiring decisions can’t wait — often does more damage to the economy than the rule itself. So that’s the real catch for the US. Push jobs offshore and it doesn’t just protect local workers but it risks losing tax dollars, startups, and the very breakthroughs that keep it ahead in the global race.

https://finshots.in/archive/gold-is-cool-but-what-about-platinum,2025-10-09,Macro,"Gold is cool, but what about Platinum?","9 October 2025 • Macro Gold is cool, but what about Platinum? In today’s Finshots, we tell you why platinum’s been on a rise lately and whether it deserves a place in the ‘safe-haven’ portfolio. But before we begin, if you’re someone who loves to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance, then hit subscribe if you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story. The Story I first got hooked on platinum as a kid when my uncle told me, “Everyone runs after gold, but it’s platinum and diamonds that are truly expensive.” That stuck somewhere in my head. And years later, right before my wedding, it popped up again. Amid all the jewellery shopping, my investor brain couldn’t help but compare gold and platinum (yeah, my gold-loving parents and in-laws didn’t like it one bit). But what I found was fascinating. See, platinum isn’t just another shiny precious metal. It belongs to a special club on the periodic table called the “platinum group metals” (PGMs) — alongside palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium, and osmium. These are some of the rarest elements on Earth. And platinum is their undisputed star. It’s incredibly dense and stable meaning it doesn’t rust, tarnish, or react with air and water. Even acids can’t corrode it, except for one rare chemical mix called “aqua regia” (a mix of nitric and hydrochloric acid) that can dissolve gold too. Hold a small cube of platinum, and it feels oddly heavy. In fact, it’s like holding condensed time itself, because platinum is older than the Earth, and scientists believe most of it came from meteorites that crashed here billions of years ago. Which means when you wear it, you’re literally wearing space metal. But that rarity takes a whole new meaning with platinum. About 70% of it comes from the Bushveld Complex in South Africa. It’s a geological formation so deep and metal-rich that miners call it “the platinum heart of the world.” Russia contributes another 10–12%, while Zimbabwe and North America fill in the rest. Extracting it, though, is a herculean task since for every 10 tonnes of ore mined, you get just a few grams of platinum. From start to finish, it can take six months to produce a single ounce of pure metal. Which brings us to today. While the internet has been focusing on gold’s rally, it’s platinum that’s been quietly outshining precious metals. It’s up about 85% versus gold’s 52% returns this year. And to understand why, let’s take it from the top. It’s a classic case of demand and supply. Let’s start with demand, which has got two big drivers. The first is autocatalysts. Nearly 40% of all platinum mined every year ends up inside car engines, sitting in tiny honeycomb-shaped devices called catalytic converters. They’re the silent heroes that turn toxic exhaust fumes into less harmful gases. It wasn’t this way all along. For decades, automakers preferred palladium for petrol engines and platinum for diesel. But when palladium prices shot past $3,000 an ounce in 2022, manufacturers began swapping it out for platinum. And that single shift, according to the World Platinum Investment Council (WPIC), could add nearly 850,000 ounces of new demand this year (roughly 12% of total global supply). The second driver is less obvious: industrial demand that comprises mostly chemical, glass and medical manufacturing, and forms about 30% of the mix. An interesting bit here is the hydrogen fuel cells, which convert hydrogen into electricity. And platinum acts as a catalyst in electrolyzers that split water into hydrogen and oxygen. So, as governments pour billions into green-hydrogen projects, platinum could quietly become the metal behind the revolution. The rest of the demand comes from jewellery (25%) and investment (about 10%). Then, there’s supply. Actually, the Earth simply doesn’t produce enough platinum. South Africa’s platinum mines are deep, old, and energy-hungry. And the country’s chronic electricity crisis has made things worse. Blackouts have halted smelters, delayed processing, and even flooded shafts. Russia, the second-largest producer, has its own headaches from sanctions, export bottlenecks, and ageing infrastructure. Combine the two, and you get what the WPIC calls a “record deficit” — nearly one million ounces short last year. But hold on. Before you think I’ve been singing platinum’s praises, let me tell you why this isn’t a sure shot ride up. Because there’s a reason platinum never became as beloved, or as stable, as gold. Just think about it. Why don’t central banks, the biggest buyers of precious metals, hoard platinum the way they hoard gold in their reserves? The answer is surprisingly philosophical. Reserves aren’t about rarity. They’re about trust and utility. Gold has millennia of faith behind it. And it’s what central banks hold because it behaves like money — standardised 400-ounce bars, deepest liquidity in the precious metals market, and a global lending & leasing network that makes it a universal hedge with zero counterparty risk. That’s the reason why, when the IMF set up the global reserve framework , gold became the chosen anchor. And it’s also why the IMF’s reserve database (COFER) tracks currencies and gold, but not platinum. Because platinum’s market is tiny (just about 5-6% of gold mining output), more industrial led as well as cyclical, and less liquid. And that’s not what central banks want. They look for a geopolitical hedge that can be mobilised in days without moving the market. In fact, central banks don’t just avoid platinum, silver, or palladium but they practically can’t hold them. That’s because these metals simply aren’t recognised by the international banking system and central banking community as monetary reserve assets. So, gold thrives on history, belief as well as supply, whereas platinum thrives on chemistry. And when the economy slows, chemistry loses to psychology. That’s why platinum prices crashed nearly 60% during the 2008 financial crisis and again after the 2015 Dieselgate scandal that wrecked diesel-engine demand in Europe. Sidebar: In 2015, the US Environmental Protection Agency discovered that Volkswagen had been rigging its cars to cheat emissions tests, allowing vehicles to emit 40 times the legal limit of nitrogen oxide for over a decade using software called a “defeat device.” This scandal came to be known as Dieselgate. You can even see it in the charts. Platinum has fallen during nearly every major US recession, often by double digits. And this goes back again to its utility. Since most of its demand is industrial, when growth cools and factories shut, the metal’s purpose pauses. Gold, meanwhile, rallies in the very same conditions. That’s why it has lagged gold and silver and has minimal investment demand compared to gold. “Okay Finshots, but what makes platinum investable for us now?”, you might ask. There’s no straight answer to that. But what you can understand is that you can profit from it by knowing that precious metals move in phases. And platinum, like all precious metals, moves in cycles. So what cycle are we in today? One way to gauge that is by looking at the capex-to-depreciation ratio. It simply tells us how much mining companies are reinvesting to replace ageing assets (or mines in this case). Right now, that ratio for platinum is at its lowest in decades. Which means miners are not spending enough to open new mines or upgrade old ones. Platinum supply actually peaked around 8 million ounces in 2019 and has been slipping since. And even if prices rise, output might not catch up for years. Sure, EVs may eventually replace normal cars and the demand for platinum could fade with it. But there’s an interesting contrast here because the world still sells about 56% internal-combustion vehicles a year of the total vehicle sales. And even trucks, hybrids, and industrial engines will need catalytic converters for years to come. Combine that with low inventories, long mining lead times, and hesitant reinvestment… and you get a market where even small demand shocks can push prices sharply higher. So when buyers can’t get enough platinum from mines, they hit the spot market. And that’s when prices start to dance. The backup source is recycled metal from old jewellery and car parts, but that market moves at a snail’s pace. It’s too small (20% of the overall platinum supply in 2024) and too illiquid to quench the kind of demand we’re seeing now. So what do you, the Indian investor, make of it all? Well, options here are limited. India doesn’t yet have a platinum ETF. You can buy physical bars or coins from select refiners, or turn to global physical ETFs. Physical platinum bars (without any jewellery modification) attract 3% GST on purchase, and a capital gains tax on sale. Not an eye popping proposition, but it’s an option if you’re looking to diversify your safe haven bets. But even if you do so, brace for volatility. Expect phases where EV headlines could scare you. And know that if deficits persist while producers stay parsimonious on capex, price has only one pressure valve left. As for the “safe haven” drawer: platinum won’t replace gold in a central bank vault or in your emergency corpus. It is, however, a mispriced claim on scarcity plus chemistry. That’s why my compromise at the wedding shopping counter was a platinum ring I could defend to the family and to my spreadsheet. Two years on, it still feels like I’m wearing a little sliver of space, and the thesis finally has company. So tell us, dear readers, where are your bets placed?

https://finshots.in/archive/understanding-confidential-ipo-india-sebi-pre-filing-drhp-us-sec-jobs-act,2025-10-08,Capital Markets,Understanding confidential IPOs,"8 October 2025 • Capital Markets Understanding confidential IPOs In today’s Finshots, we tell you why more and more Indian companies are taking the confidential pre-filing IPO route before hitting the bourses. But before we begin, if you’re someone who loves to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance, then hit subscribe if you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story. The Story Let’s say it’s your 25th birthday next month, and you’re also expecting a fat Diwali bonus. You’re excited and tell everyone you know that you’re throwing a grand birthday dinner. You start planning early — the menu, the decor, the guest list, everything! But then Diwali comes and goes… and that big bonus your company gave you hopes of, never shows up. Suddenly, your party plans don’t quite fit the budget. You scale things down, cancel a few invites, and make do with a smaller celebration. The next day, there’s chaos. Friends whisper about how they were “supposed” to be invited to this grand bash that never really happened for them at least. Basically, not quite the birthday you imagined. Now let’s flip the story. This time, you keep your plans to yourself and wait until the bonus actually clinks in your account. When it does, you set a budget, finalise the guest list, send out invites, and host the perfect evening. The party goes smoothly, everyone has a blast, and months later, people are still talking about it. Now, I don’t need to ask which version you’d prefer. It’s undoubtedly the second one. And honestly, that’s exactly how, many companies eyeing a future stock market listing are thinking these days. For context, a few days ago, Infra.Market , a marketplace for construction materials, quietly filed its DRHP (Draft Red Herring Prospectus) with SEBI via the confidential, or what’s called, the “pre-filing” route. Now, when a unicorn like Infra.Market, valued at a whopping $2.8 billion (₹24,850 crores), makes such a move, you’d expect the markets and media to be buzzing. But all that happened with Infra.Market were a few newspaper announcements, each carrying a disclaimer that “the pre-filing of the offer document shall not necessarily mean that the issuer will undertake the initial public offering”. And this isn’t an isolated case. Even Tata Capital’s IPO , whose subscription closes today, began with a confidential DRHP filing. In fact, ever since SEBI introduced this route in November 2022, 22 companies have filed their DRHPs quietly — 18 of them in 2025 alone. So it naturally makes you wonder, “Why are so many Indian companies choosing the hush-hush route before stepping into the spotlight?” Well, the opening example probably gave you a big clue. Companies prefer to keep their plans, and their numbers, under wraps until they’re absolutely sure about going public. Because if, after all that effort, they decide to hold off on the IPO, it can trigger a storm of speculation. The media starts talking, investors begin doubting, and the company’s reputation takes a hit. It’s something that could haunt it the next time it tries to raise funds. But that’s not the only reason. See, when a company files for an IPO the traditional way, its DRHP document becomes public for at least 21 days initially. Investors can comment, the media picks it up, and SEBI and the stock exchanges begin their review. Once they’re satisfied, the SEBI issues an observation letter, and the company gets 12 months to launch the IPO, after updating the DRHP with any changes, of course, and publishing what’s called the RHP (the final document before an IPO). Now here’s the catch. The entire DRHP, packed with business details, stays in the public domain through all of this. And that’s exactly what many firms want to avoid. Take Swiggy, for instance. It chose the confidential route for a reason. If it had gone the traditional way, rivals could’ve easily accessed crucial data . Especially from Instamart, its quick commerce arm, like numbers, pricing strategies, customer insights, and even valuation details. That’s like handing competitors a cheat sheet before the game begins. And no company wants to leak that kind of information before it’s sure about going public. Because one of the trickiest parts of the DRHP process is handling revisions when SEBI or stock exchanges ask for clarifications. Sure, it’s a normal part of the procedure, but things can get messy when the media turns every back-and-forth into a headline. The WeWork India IPO , which just closed its subscription, is one of the best examples. While the IPO was fully subscribed, retail investors have raised concerns about alleged irregularities in the DRHP and questioned SEBI’s inaction. That’s not a good look, especially when the IPO is live, since it can impact subscription, valuations and how investors react once shares are allotted. Now contrast all of this with the confidential route and you see the big advantage that often gets overlooked. Founders here retain control over every stage. Unlike the traditional path, the confidential DRHP stays under wraps until SEBI issues its observation letter, with only limited visibility among qualified institutional buyers (QIBs). That’s a fancy term for sophisticated investors like mutual funds, banks, and insurance companies. And once SEBI offers its observations, the company has up to 18 months to launch the IPO or withdraw, as long as it files an updated DRHP within 16 months. That’s more time than the traditional route. And this gives companies the flexibility to pause if market conditions aren’t ideal — whether it’s geopolitical tensions, trade wars, or a market bloodbath; without having to justify it publicly. Founders can gauge the market quietly and decide what timing’s the best. But there’s a small caveat here too, something analysts were worried about when the US opened up the confidential IPO route for companies intending to go public. See, the US introduced this route in 2012 to help smaller companies and startups with less than $1 billion in annual revenue go public without the fear of public scrutiny. By 2017, its market regulator, the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), extended the option to all companies looking to list. And since then, 86% of US companies have used the confidential route to begin their IPO process. But the thing is that besides the company’s executives, outside lawyers and bankers also get involved. That means the government or regulator’s employees may know inside details about pending offerings before investors do. And while it’s not easy to profit from this information, history shows that leaks and trading on insider knowledge aren’t unheard of. SEC employees themselves have been charged with trading stocks of companies under investigation, using unpublished, price-sensitive information to profit depending on whether the outcome of the investigation was positive or negative. So yeah, if such information slips out during an IPO’s pre-filing, it’s not all that different from regular public scrutiny. But honestly, that’s a minor hiccup in the bigger picture. What really matters is how this gives companies the confidence to go public on their own terms, helping them raise funds and strengthen India’s capital markets. Until next time… Don’t forget to share this story on WhatsApp , LinkedIn , and X .

https://finshots.in/archive/the-lg-electronics-india-ipo,2025-10-07,Capital Markets,The LG Electronics India IPO,"7 October 2025 • Capital Markets The LG Electronics India IPO In today’s Finshots, we break down the LG Electronics India IPO, which opens for subscription today and closes on October 9 th . But before we begin, if you love keeping up with the buzz in business and finance, make sure to subscribe and join the Finshots club, loved by over 5 lakh readers. Already a subscriber or reading this on the app? You’re all set. Let's get started with the story! The Story You’re probably thinking, “Another IPO? Haven’t we had enough already?” Fair point. But this one’s not your regular market debut. It’s the biggest listing of the year after Tata Capital, and it comes from a company that’s probably sitting right in your living room. Because if you grew up in an Indian home in the 2000s, you already know LG. The maroon logo with a smiley on your fridge, or your TV, or the washing machine humming in the corner. It wasn’t just another brand but a part of many Indians’ daily life. And now, that same company wants to sit not just in your living room but in your portfolio. LG Electronics, the Korean parent, is taking its Indian arm public. The offer size is ₹11,607 crores , and not a rupee of it will go to the company. It’s a pure offer-for-sale (OFS) where the parent is simply cashing out a slice of its stake after nearly three decades in India. Which begs the question – why list something that doesn’t need the money? Well, because LG India has quietly grown into a heavyweight that deserves its own valuation tag. And India’s electronics market is a good example of why. Air conditioners have more than doubled in size, from ₹1.55 lakh crore in 2019 to ₹3.2 lakh crore in 2024. Home entertainment systems have expanded 2.5x in the same period, from ₹37,000 crore to ₹89,500 crore. But despite this boom, India still lags far behind other nations. Refrigerators reach only 35% of Indian homes, compared to 99% in China and 80% in the US. Washing machines? Just 22%. And microwaves? Barely 4%, versus 80% in the US and 20% in China. And come to think of it, that’s more of a potential runway for growth than a problem. And that’s the bet LG wants to own. The growth potential it is looking for is the untouched markets. The metros are saturated. The next frontier is Tier-2 and Tier-3 India, where rising incomes are meeting rising aspirations, and where appliances are still status symbols. So for LG India, that’s the new battleground. And with decades of trust and a massive presence, it could start with an upper hand. Its business today is split across two pillars: home applications and air solutions, and home entertainment. The first covers washing machines, refrigerators, and air-conditioners; the second includes TVs and audio systems. Together, they’ve built India’s largest consumer electronics distribution network with over 35,000 retail (B2C) touchpoints spanning metros and small towns alike. And it doesn’t stop there. LG also runs the country’s biggest after-sales service network with 1,000+ service centres and over 13,000 service engineers. On the manufacturing side, its two plants — in Pune and Noida — can churn out 14.5 million products a year. That makes LG the largest in-house manufacturer of appliances in India. More importantly, the plants are designed for flexibility: a single assembly line can handle multiple products. And over half of LG’s raw materials (about 54%) now come from Indian suppliers, thanks to local vendor tie-ups. That means faster production, lower import bills, and stronger “Make in India” credentials. This scale and integration have made LG a market leader across four key categories — washing machines, refrigerators, TVs, and inverter ACs. In FY25, its home appliances and air solutions division brought in ₹18,267 crores, or 75% of total revenue. Home entertainment added the remaining 25% with ₹5,672 crores. And that took the overall revenue to ₹24,366 crores, a steady rise from ₹21,352 crores a year earlier. Profits follow a similar pattern. LG India’s profit after tax (PAT), or the money left after paying all expenses and taxes, has risen steadily from ₹1,348 crores in FY23 to ₹1,511 crores in FY24, and ₹2,203 crores in FY25. Its return on equity (ROE), which measures how much profit a company generates for every rupee of shareholder money, improved from 27% in FY23 to 45% in FY25, while return on capital employed (ROCE) rose from 39% to 47% during the same period, showing just how efficiently LG uses its assets. So yeah, those are strong numbers for a 28-year old business. Which also answers our first question as to why the IPO isn’t about fundraising but signalling. That LG India is now big, profitable, and mature enough to stand on its own. The parent company is trying to unlock shareholder value, and prices LG’s India operations based on its individual performance. And it’s not an empty claim. Revenues have grown at 10.7% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) between FY23 and FY25. The company also plans to deepen localisation further and may even set up a third plant in Andhra Pradesh. So even though the IPO proceeds won’t flow into India operations, listing visibility itself could strengthen partnerships and supplier confidence. All of which brings us to valuations of the IPO. The IPO price band is set at ₹1,080–₹1,140, implying a price to earnings (P/E) multiple of roughly 33–35x and a market cap of ₹77,000 crores. That’s lower than the industry average of 43x and puts LG India just below Havells (₹93,000 crore) in market valuations. Sure, there are other domestic peers like Voltas, Whirlpool, Blue Star, but they are smaller and less diversified. And since global rivals like Samsung, Sony, and Haier aren’t listed here, LG’s IPO stands out as India’s first true consumer-electronics giant on Dalal Street. But every legacy also has its cracks and you could see some for LG Electronics India too. Nearly 75% of LG India’s revenue in FY25 went into raw material costs, and 46% of those materials are imported from China, Korea, and Singapore. That leaves it vulnerable to currency swings and supply disruptions. It’s why the company has been actively working to localise more of its supply network and reduce import dependence. Competition in urban markets also remains brutal. So the next phase of growth depends on expanding deeper into India’s hinterland, where affordability and service reliability could decide who wins. Then there’s the dependency risk. LG India operates under a licensing agreement with the Korean parent, paying royalties of 2.3–2.4% (depending on the product) of sales for using its brand and technology. That’s fine when relations are steady. But if the parent tweaks terms or withdraws access, the Indian arm could lose the very identity that built its success. The parent company also owns another Indian subsidiary, Hi-M Solutek, which handles maintenance for LG’s air-conditioners. For now, it works exclusively with LG India — but the contract isn’t binding. Any shift there could disrupt its massive service backbone. And there’s also a ₹4,717 crore tax dispute hanging over the company, which is nearly 73% of its current net worth. If the verdict doesn’t go its way, it could dent future profits. Still, despite those risks, this isn’t a company selling a dream. It’s selling a record. It’s not asking for money to build something new; it’s inviting investors to value what’s already built. And only time will tell whether that ‘Lucky Goldstar’ turns out to be lucky for investors too.

But before we begin, if you love keeping up with the buzz in business and finance, make sure to subscribe and join the Finshots club, loved by over 5 lakh readers. Already a subscriber or reading this on the app? You’re all set. Let's get started with the story! The Story What happens when the code building your cars stalls before the engines do? A multi-million pound breakdown, closed factories, and a workforce with no choice but to stay indoors. This was the reality that Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) faced when a cyberattack struck in August. For almost a month, its factories lay defunct — not just in the UK, but also in Slovakia, Brazil, and India. In fact, JLR hasn’t produced a single car since 31st August. But it wasn’t the only company under attack. The UK has seen a string of cyberattacks this year. Marks & Spencer’s (M&S) website and app were down in April due to a ransomware attack. Shoppers couldn’t make online purchases, and services were restored only recently. Another retail chain, the Co-op, also suffered a similar attack that cost it over £80 million in profits. But while M&S and the Co-op eventually bounced back, the impact on JLR has been far greater. Every week its factories stayed shut, cost the company £50 million. So why was JLR hit the hardest? For that you’ll have to first understand what actually happened. It started two years ago, when JLR signed a five-year, £800 million deal with TCS to rebuild its tech infrastructure. Since JLR has been owned by Tata since 2008, handing the job to Tata’s IT arm seemed natural. The plan was to modernise JLR’s digital systems, including a massive upgrade to SAP software — the system that controls how car parts move around factories, how suppliers are linked, and even how luxury models are customised for top paying customers. In short, it was the backbone of JLR’s global production. But the problem was that JLR had connected “everything to everything” — from smart factories to supplier systems. So when hackers (likely groups such as Scattered Spider, Lapsus$, or ShinyHunters) struck its core IT systems, production had to be halted immediately. And unlike older setups, JLR had to shut down almost everything, instead of just isolating the affected parts. The attack blocked access to critical systems that ran production lines, orders, payments, and even basic communication. Which means that JLR couldn’t build vehicles, place or pay for parts, or even process supplier invoices. For weeks, employees, suppliers, and logistics partners were left in limbo. So the bottom line was that the IT overhaul meant to make JLR more efficient ended up exposing its biggest weakness. But why does a cyberattack on just one automaker matter so much to the UK, you ask? Well, you see, JLR began life in 1922 making motorcycle sidecars in the UK. Fast forward a century, and it has grown into a multinational automaker designing, engineering, and building some of the world’s most recognisable luxury vehicles. Today, it’s not just another car company, but a pillar of the UK’s auto sector and a big cog in the broader economy. To put things in perspective, in 2024 alone, JLR contributed about £17.9 billion to the UK economy. That’s roughly 0.6% of the country’s GDP. It directly employs around 33,000 people in the UK, with a supply chain that supports another 2 lakh jobs across hundreds of firms, many of them specialised local suppliers. In the West Midlands alone, where JLR’s main plants sit, it makes up nearly 5% of the regional economy. And it’s not just about the sheer volume of cars it produces — nearly 1,000 vehicles a day at peak, but also exports, high-skilled jobs, and innovation in electric vehicles. So when JLR’s systems went dark, the ripple effects were brutal. Almost half its suppliers reported financial pain including unpaid invoices, delayed orders, and mounting costs. For many who depended solely on JLR, the shutdown meant layoffs, reduced hours, or even the threat of bankruptcy. Banks became reluctant to offer loans to affected suppliers without personal guarantees or collateral such as their homes, pushing many into liquidity crises. It got so bad that suppliers appealed for government help. And the UK government had to step in, touring factories and eventually guaranteeing JLR a £1.5 billion loan to keep its supply chain afloat. What you can’t ignore is that this came at a time when UK manufacturing was already reeling from its worst slump since Covid. September was their worst month, with growth falling to a 4 month low , and energy and manufacturing costs rising. And just when things looked fragile, cyberattacks froze production. For Tata Motors too, the stakes are high. With 70% of its revenue tied to JLR, the parent company could be staring at a weak profit engine ahead. And absorbing the hit, especially without the cushion of cyber insurance, only makes the blow harder. Yup, you read that right. A Reuters story suggests that JLR didn’t have cybersecurity insurance, meaning they had to bear all the costs from the attack. They had not finalised a cyber insurance policy brokered by Lockton before the attack and therefore appear to have had no active cover for this incident. All of this makes you wonder — how do you fix this, and more importantly, stop it from happening again? It’s going to take more than quick IT fixes. Companies like JLR need to treat cybersecurity the way they treat car safety. It’s not optional. That means building a proper cyber resilience framework that covers both the digital side and the factory floor. Regular risk checks, supplier audits, and learning from past incidents — whether it’s JLR’s own hack or other high-profile breaches, should be the norm. But the basics matter most. Strong access controls with multi-factor authentication, regular password updates, and systems that can spot unusual activity early can make a huge difference. On the operational side, JLR needs a “what if everything stops?” plan. Meaning, modern factories need a zero-trust approach where they assume that networks could already be compromised and focus on quick containment and response. Tested plans for downtime, supply chain delays, or production halts are crucial. And training employees for cyberattacks is just as important as fire drills. They could in fact, simulate attacks before they happen. Tabletop exercises and team drills that mimic real hackers expose weak spots, test defences, and ensure teams know exactly how to respond. Because the faster a company can detect, contain, and recover, the smaller the fallout. That way the next time a Range Rover rolls off the line, it won’t just be a triumph of engineering, it will be proof that in modern manufacturing, lines of code are as critical as bolts and engines. Until then… If this story helped you quickly make sense of the JLR cyberattack and its ripple effects on the UK’s auto industry, share it with friends, family, or even strangers on WhatsApp , LinkedIn , and X . After all, it’s always nicer to have a smarter bunch of folks around you. Myth Alert: I'm Too Young to Buy Life Insurance!

https://finshots.in/archive/isabgol-problems-fat-bear-week-and-more-2,2025-10-05,Sunny Side Up,"🍳Isabgol problems, Fat Bear Week, and more...","5 October 2025 • Sunny Side Up 🍳Isabgol problems, Fat Bear Week, and more... Hey folks! Every October in Alaska, the internet goes wild… because of bears. Yes, bears. And it’s all for the crown of biggest, fluffiest bear of the year. Winter is coming, and these guys need to bulk up for months of hibernation. But humans turned it into a fun contest where anyone, anywhere, can vote for their favourite “hibernator”. At Katmai National Park, the bear with the most votes wins Fat Bear Week . Over a million votes pour in from 100+ countries, all watching live on hidden bear cams. What started in 2014 as a way to teach people about bears has now become a global online tradition. Ranger Mike Fitz remembers spotting a fan post two photos of the same bear — one in June and one in September. And the difference was jaw-dropping. Inspired, rangers hosted the first official Fat Bear Week in 2015. A decade later, it’s still going strong. But Katmai isn’t just about the competition. The park is home to over 2,200 bears , more than anywhere else in the world, and it’s packed with sockeye salmon — the secret to these bears growing massive for the long winter ahead. Now you might wonder why it’s a voting contest and not based on size or weight. Well… have you ever heard of anyone convincing a wild bear to step on a scale? Me neither. So yeah, until that happens, the voting is based on overall roundness and how well each bear has prepared for winter hibernation. This year’s winner is aptly named Chunk . Despite a broken jaw, he gorged on salmon, bulked up to around 500 kg , and beat 11 other competitors by over 30,000 votes. Beary interesting, eh? Here’s a soundtrack to put you in the mood 🎵 Soma by Iyer’s Filter Coffee By the way, we’ve run out of your song suggestions, so we went ahead and picked one ourselves. But we love listening to your picks and sharing them with our readers. So don’t leave us hanging. Send more songs our way! Now, let’s get cracking. What caught our eye this week 👀 India’s Isabgol Problem About 22% of adult Indians suffer from constipation. Now, that’s not exactly the kind of stat you’d expect us to kick off a Sunny Side Up story with. But we had to, because the solution to India’s constipation problem is stuck in a problem of its own. Here’s what we mean. Just yesterday, isabgol processors threatened to stop buying isabgol seeds from farmers starting Monday (October 6th). The reason? A messy GST confusion that’s been choking their business. For context, India is the world’s largest producer of psyllium husk, or what we all know as isabgol. It’s basically a soluble fibre made from the seeds of plantago ovata, a herb that grows widely here. Farmers harvest the seeds, processors turn them into husk or powder, and voilà, you get that age-old remedy for digestive troubles. Rajasthan grows nearly 70% of India’s isabgol crop, while 90% of the processing happens in Gujarat. But what’s even more interesting is that over 90% of this husk doesn’t even stay in India. It’s shipped off to the US, Europe, and Korea, where it’s in huge demand as a dietary fibre supplement and a medicinal laxative. And lately, it’s even caught the fancy of health-conscious youngsters abroad, who see it as a natural substitute (although unproven) for trendy weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic . But here’s where the troubles begin. Before GST replaced VAT in 2017, isabgol was exempt from tax. But under GST, only fresh isabgol seeds were exempt. Dried seeds and husk, on the other hand, attracted a 5% levy. The problem though is that the law doesn’t clearly define what “fresh” actually means. And since processors typically buy through APMC markets (regulated marketplaces set up by state governments to ensure farmers get a fair price and aren’t exploited by middlemen) — where it’s tough to certify whether seeds are fresh or dried, they play it safe and just pay GST on everything. Now, in theory, these GST payments get refunded later. But in practice, the refunds take ages. That means processors end up parking huge sums of money with tax authorities, when these funds could have otherwise kept their factories running smoothly. Add to this the pain of international tariffs that have already slowed export orders, and you can see why cash flow is giving them indigestion. And that’s why processors are threatening to shut down purchases, which is a huge problem. Because if they don’t buy seeds, the whole chain collapses. Farmers lose buyers, processors won’t run plants, and export orders will decline further. That’s a big deal for a country that dominates the global isabgol market. So yeah, until processors can “ease the constipation” of their blocked GST refunds, they don’t want to stock up on the very crop that has kept Indians… ahem… regular for decades. Now, it’s up to the government to prescribe the right medicine to fix this regulatory mess. Infographic 📊 📺What if India abolished all taxes?

In this week’s wrapup, we talk about private gold mining in India, how India became a French fry powerhouse, and why SMBC chose Yes Bank over Kotak Mahindra Bank to become its biggest shareholder.

With that out of the way, let’s look back at what we wrote this week. The gold rush begins at home India’s love for gold is a story that never ends. And to keep that love alive, we import about 1,000 tonnes of gold each year, but mine only about 1.5 tonnes from our own soil. Which honestly makes you wonder — if demand is so huge, why don’t we mine more at home? There are legacy mines that go back to pre-Independence, like KGF and Hutti. When KGF closed in 2001, it mined about 800 tonnes of gold. It eventually shut down because mining became too expensive. Even with the few mines operating today, production still falls short of demand, partly due to policies that remained in place until the 2023 Mines and Minerals Act. But for the first time, private gold exploration and mining in India has become a reality — the first proof of concept being the Jonnagiri gold project in Andhra Pradesh. Its first year might see an output of 750 kg, a modest number compared to imports, but enough to set an example. So, what does this mean for other critical minerals lying beneath our ground? Find out in our Monday story here . How India quietly became a French fry powerhouse Did you know that the potato is India’s most eaten vegetable? We produce nearly 60 million tonnes every year, making us the second-largest potato grower in the world. But until a few years ago, if you ordered French fries at McDonald’s, chances are those frozen spuds came from Europe. That story has changed lanes now with India exporting frozen potato products worth nearly ₹1,817 crores in FY25. That’s almost nine times what we did five years ago, with Gujarat at the heart of this transformation, producing around 80% of the country’s processed potatoes. So, how did a humble potato conquer the world’s French fry orders? Check out our Tuesday story here for the full ‘batata’ revolution. Why did SMBC choose Yes Bank over Kotak Mahindra Bank SMBC (Sumitomo Mitsubishi Banking Corporation) held a slice in one of India’s leading banks: Kotak Mahindra. And on paper, that investment had almost everything: A CASA (Current Account and Savings Account) of 40%, an ROE (Return on Equity) of 12% and the stability that came from vesting in a large player. But one thing that it lacked was boardroom representation. Call it prestige without power, and that might be one of the reasons why SMBC walked away and picked Yes Bank. But why Yes Bank?

https://finshots.in/markets/the-tata-capital-ipo-explained,2025-10-03,Markets,The Tata Capital IPO explained,"3 October 2025 • Markets The Tata Capital IPO explained In today’s Finshots, we take a closer look at 2025’s most awaited IPO — the Tata Capital IPO, which opens for subscription on Monday, October 6th, and closes on October 8th. The Story This story barely needs an introduction. You probably already know Tata Capital as the financial services arm of the mighty Tata group. It kicked off in 2007 with the simple idea of offering financial services to retail customers, small businesses, and corporates. But as years passed by, the company widened its net. From consumer loans to commercial finance to wealth advisory, it slowly built itself into a brand that comfortably sat under the Tata umbrella. Fast forward to today and Tata Capital isn’t just another NBFC (Non-Banking Financial Company). It’s India’s third-largest diversified NBFC with assets under management or total loan book, standing tall at ₹2.33 lakh crores. And now, it’s gearing up to hit the market with a huge ₹15,512 crore IPO . The larger portion of this or ₹8,666 crores is an offer for sale. That’s basically Tata Sons (which owns 88.6% of Tata Capital) and another key shareholder, International Finance Corporation, cashing out a bit of their stake. Together, they own over 90% of the company. And post-IPO, the overall promoter holding will fall from 95.6% to about 85.5%. The remaining or ₹6,846 crores is a fresh issue. And that’s money Tata Capital will actually keep to strengthen its Tier-I capital. Think of this as the company’s financial cushion, made up largely of shareholders’ money and retained earnings. The RBI insists that NBFCs maintain a strong buffer like this to ensure that they can absorb risks if loans go bad. And for Tata Capital, topping up this safety cushion doesn’t just mean ticking a regulatory box. It also creates more room to lend in the future. But does all of this automatically make its IPO a must-buy, you ask? Well, to figure that out, you’ll need to dig into a few key numbers. Because it’s these metrics that will tell you whether 2025’s most hyped IPO actually lives up to the chatter. Let’s start with the topline or the company’s income. In FY25, Tata Capital clocked in about ₹28,300 crores in revenue from operations. That’s no small feat. In fact, it translates into a solid 44% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over just the past two years, which seems impressive. But, when it comes to lending businesses like this, one number investors love to track is the Net Interest Margin (NIM). In simple terms, it’s the spread between what Tata Capital earns on the loans it gives out and what it has to pay on the money it borrows — be it bonds, bank loans, or deposits. For Tata Capital, this margin currently sits at 5.2%. That’s not bad at all. But here’s the catch. It’s lower than the peer average of 7.6%. Big names like Bajaj Finance and Shriram Finance are miles ahead, with margins pushing 9.5–10%. Still, profits look healthy. Tata Capital pulled in ₹3,655 crores in FY25, growing at about 11% CAGR since FY23. But revenue and profits don’t paint the full picture. You also need to check how efficiently the company puts money to work. That’s where ratios like ROE (Return on Equity) and ROA (Return on Assets) step in. ROE tells you how much profit Tata Capital makes from every rupee of investor money. Here, it stands at 12.6%. Decent, but again, peers average closer to 16%. ROA, on the other hand, measures how effectively the company uses its loan book and investments to churn out profits. Tata Capital sits at 1.8%, while competitors average around 3.2%. Here’s the silver lining, though. If you look at asset quality, Tata Capital has been holding its ground quite well. Its Gross Stage 3 loans — basically loans that haven’t been repaid for more than 90 days, have been steady between 1.5–2% over FY23 to FY25. That’s stronger than the industry average of about 2.6%, which shows that it does seem to have tighter control over the quality of its loan book. But even with these positives, there are a few risk factors you can’t ignore. Take its loan book, for example. On the surface, it looks well spread out across retail, SME, and corporate customers. And thanks to its recent merger with TMFL, Tata Motors’ financing arm, it’s now a serious contender in vehicle finance too. TMFL alone brings in a big chunk of the commercial vehicle loans for the combined company. But the worrisome part is its unsecured loans or loans given without any collateral to fall back on, have consistently made up more than 20% of Tata Capital’s portfolio over the past three years. That’s not a small number. If too many borrowers default, it could eat into asset quality (which, to be fair, is currently better than peers) and force the company to set aside higher provisions. And that could hurt profitability down the line. Then there’s the legal overhang. Tata Capital has 283 criminal cases pending against it. Most of these revolve around loan disputes, repossession of vehicles, forgery allegations, or settlement issues. Typically, its borrowers or guarantors have taken the company or its employees to court and filed FIRs, claiming foul play. And while not all of these cases may be material in nature, together they add up to a contingent liability of ₹765 crores. To put that in context, this figure is way above the materiality threshold of ₹165 crores, which is 5% of the company’s average profit after tax over the past three years. And finally, there’s the valuation question. At the top end of the price band of ₹326 per share, Tata Capital would be valued at 33 times its earnings over the last twelve months and 4.2 times its book value. Compare that to its peers, which trade at a P/E (Price-to-Earnings ratio) of 27.2 and a P/B (Price-to-Book value) of 3.6, and it’s clear the stock looks a bit pricey. Add to that a market that’s already seeing a flood of massive IPOs, and this one could feel like a lot to digest. The Economic Times recently highlighted how mega IPOs over ₹10,000 crores have often disappointed. Take HDB Financial’s ₹12,500 crore IPO. It spiked 14% on listing day, but today it trades just 4% above its issue price. Or last year’s NTPC Green Energy ₹10,000 crore offering, which still lingers below its ₹108 issue price. And with LG Electronics’ IPO coming up next week, investors may feel a little overwhelmed. So yeah, whether they'll still jump in on Tata Capital is something we’ll have to wait and see. Even if they do, it may be more to do with the Tata tag rather than immediate gains, despite this being one of the year’s biggest IPOs.

In today’s Finshots, we unpack why a Japanese giant gave up on Kotak Mahindra Bank to back a once-battered lender, and why, sometimes, control beats comfort. But a quick sidenote before we begin: 18% GST on Insurance Is Gone. What Now? Since 22nd September, the 18% GST on insurance premiums has been removed. Policies are now cheaper, but the real question is: which one should you get and how much cover do you actually need? That’s where our 2-day masterclass comes in. We’ll break down health and life insurance in simple, jargon free steps so you can make the most of this change and avoid costly mistakes. 👉🏽Click here to reserve your spot today! Now, onto today’s story. The Story Imagine you walk into a museum and see a masterpiece. No dust, no cracks, no sign of chaos. It’s flawless. But the moment you try to touch it, a siren goes off. Because perfect things aren’t meant to be altered. They’re meant to be admired from a distance. That’s exactly how SMBC (Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation) – the Japanese banking giant – felt holding a slice of Kotak Mahindra Bank. You see, on paper, Kotak was perfect. It had a return on equity of over 12%. A CASA ratio of around 40%. It was prized for discipline and loved by the markets, but also priced like it. SMBC held a 1.65% stake in the bank, earning the satisfaction that comes with owning a quality franchise. The catch? It was just a passive stake. No representation in the boardroom, no say in strategy, and no way to leverage its global strengths in trade finance or corporate banking beyond what Kotak already excels in. This is why SMBC walked away. In Kotak, it held prestige without power. In Yes Bank, it saw a second chance not just to invest, but to influence. But why Yes Bank? After all, back in 2020 , the company teetered on the edge of collapse. A ballooning pile of bad loans, sudden exits at the top, and a government-imposed moratorium on withdrawals turned the once high-flying bank into a cautionary tale. But the turnaround since then has been real. Under new leadership, gross and net non-performing assets (NPAs) have dropped to around 1.6%, deposits have bounced back to ₹2.85 lakh crore , and FY25 profits jumped over 64% . Sure, margins still trail top-tier peers, and legal baggage hasn’t vanished. Nobody’s calling it a finished product. But that’s exactly where the opportunity is buried. Yes Bank trades at just 1.4x book, the kind of valuation gap that excites growth-hungry investors. It’s the classic deep-value setup: embrace complexity, demand influence, and reap the upside if the rebuild holds. And this is where the difference lies. In Kotak, SMBC was a polite minority. At Yes Bank, it becomes the largest shareholder, holding just under 25% , with voting rights, two board seats, and equity affiliate status. Board representation enables SMBC to push governance forward, accelerate tech and risk upgrades, and, most importantly, integrate its Japan-based relationships directly into an Indian franchise that can serve those customers end-to-end. Think of the synergy map. SMBC sits on a deep roster of Japanese manufacturers, auto ancillaries, electronics suppliers, and trading houses expanding across India’s industrial corridors. Those clients require working capital lines, supply chain finance, foreign exchange risk coverage, cash management, and letters of credit. Then, there’s a second, subtler benefit. Turnarounds are powered by credibility arbitrage. A large, methodical shareholder with skin in the game shortens the time it takes for other stakeholders, depositors, bondholders, and rating agencies to gain confidence. You can’t just conjure that with press releases. You earn it with visible governance and the kind of oversight that only a board seat buys. “But wasn’t Kotak the safer compounding machine?” Absolutely, and it still is. But that could also be a problem for a strategic investor looking for more than passive compounding. A premium-valued bank leaves little leftover return unless you bring a new engine of growth to justify an even higher multiple. With Yes Bank, the risk is higher, sure, but the levers are real: asset-mix upgrades, better pricing on corporate and SME books, cross-sell into a 1,200-branch network, and a digital stack that can be tightened with Japanese precision. Of course, this isn’t a fairy tale. Yes Bank’s margin profile remains squeezed compared to top-tier peers; the retail business takes time to rebuild, and corporate pricing is competitive. The legal overhang from legacy episodes still hasn’t disappeared. And a big investor can’t just micromanage collection zones or credit committees. The execution still sits with the management. But a partner like SMBC can tilt the odds with strong second-line risk teams, sharper treasury practices, and a pipeline of anchor clients that raise the average credit quality. After all, these are the compounding details turnarounds are made of. So, why not split the difference and own both? Well, that’s easier said than done. You see, SMBC wasn’t just allocating to “India financials.” It was buying a role. In Kotak, the role was that of a spectator. In Yes Bank, it’s a co-author. And the trade-off is a classic finance dilemma: influence over inertia vs controlled risk for premium comfort. If this thesis holds, here’s how it could play out: Deposit costs continue to ease as confidence builds. The mix tilts toward better-rated corporate and SME borrowers, aided by SMBC relationships, which lifts the risk-adjusted yield. Fee income climbs on trade finance and cash management. Credit costs remain contained if underwriting discipline is maintained. Combine these and book value compounds faster than the market anticipates. At that point, the multiple (1.4x Price-Book ratio today) has room to rerate without stretching credulity. You don’t need perfection but steady, boring progress. And if it doesn’t? Then the downside of a turnaround is the same as its lure: volatility. Legal surprises, a credit shock, or sloppy growth could crimp the story. The difference now is that a large shareholder has the tools and the obligation to course-correct inside the room, not from the sidelines. So, the bottom line is simple. SMBC didn’t really choose “Yes Bank over Kotak.” It chose influence over inertia. It traded a premium, passive slice of a finished franchise for a meaningful stake in an unfinished one, with governance levers, two board seats, and the ability to integrate global clients into a domestic network. If the rebuild continues, the payoff can be outsized. If it stumbles, the costs will be visible and shared. And that’s the bet: not just parking capital in India, but planting a flag in a bank that can still change shape, and letting that change drive returns. Until then… Sharing is caring.

Until then, kick back, enjoy the holidays, and don’t miss us too much! 🙂 Now, onto today’s story. The Story The global French fries market is worth around $24 billion . But if you rewind by a couple of decades, India was nowhere in the picture or close to making or exporting these crispy snacks. Fast forward to today and the story looks very different. Potatoes have become India’s most eaten vegetable , and French fries have found their way into just about every menu. For context, India now produces a whopping 60 million tonnes of potatoes every year, second only to China. And we’re not just eating them, we’re exporting them too. In FY25 alone, India shipped frozen potato products worth ₹1,817 crores. That’s nearly nine times what we managed just five years ago, when exports were barely ₹217 crores. And quite surprising too, considering that India was once a net importer, bringing in 5,000–7,000 tonnes of potatoes a year in the mid-2000s. Which naturally makes you wonder — how did this crispy love affair with French fries really begin? And how did India turn into such a big player in the game? To begin with, it makes sense that India was once an importer of potatoes and fries. After all, the potato isn’t even native to India. It first sprouted in the Andes of South America and only made its way here in the late 16th or early 17th century, thanks to European traders. The Portuguese are believed to have brought the ‘batata’ to the Malabar coast, but it was the British who really pushed it across the country, especially in Bengal. For them, the potato was a handy famine-relief crop and a reliable staple that could thrive in India’s varied climates. And that’s how it became part of our home kitchens. But these were just your everyday table potatoes — the kind you’d buy in a local market and cook at home. They didn’t fetch much money, mainly because India didn’t yet have the right varieties for processing or export. International buyers also demanded strict quality standards, and most small farmers simply couldn’t meet them. Add to that the lack of cold storage and transport facilities, and farmers didn’t have much incentive to grow potatoes commercially. In fact, things were often so bad that farmers in states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal sometimes had to dump their produce, or even replant the same potatoes back into the soil, because selling them in the market wouldn’t cover their costs. That began to change in the early 2000s, thanks to McCain Foods — the world’s largest producer of frozen potato products and the brand most of us know for its ready-to-cook snacks like French fries, burger patties, aloo tikki and more. McCain came to India in 1998, dabbling in agricultural R&D and trying to build a frozen food market. But it wouldn’t be fair to call them the pioneers because Lamb Weston, another American food giant, had been in India long before, importing frozen French fries for big star restaurants. McCain noticed how popular fries were getting and decided to join the party. And in 2007, they set up their first potato processing plant in Mehsana, Gujarat. And soon enough, it struck gold by becoming the exclusive supplier of frozen fries to McDonald’s, right after the US fast-food chain opened its first outlet here. That momentum didn’t go unnoticed. Indian potato-processing companies like HyFun Foods, Iscon Balaji Foods, Funwave Foods and ChillFill Foods jumped onto the bandwagon, and today, they rank among the country’s biggest potato processors alongside McCain. They saw how global giants such as Cavendish, Lamb Weston, McCain and JR Simplot, built empires out of fries, and they wanted a bite of that pie too. And the way they went about it was simple. They started striking contracts with farmers, agreeing on the price and quality of potatoes they’d supply. In return, farmers received benefits like assured prices and markets, access to credit, quality seeds, and guidance on better crop-growing practices. But these weren’t the everyday potatoes you find in your kitchen. These were special varieties, bred specifically for processed snacks like French fries. Like Santana and Frysona, the two big names in the global fries game. These potatoes, originally from Europe, are oblong, yellow-fleshed, high in starch, and low in sugar. That’s what gives fries their perfect crispiness and golden colour. Indian table varieties just can’t match them as they’re too watery and sugary, which makes fries brown too fast or cook unevenly. Interestingly, these foreign varieties thrive on Indian soil too, especially in Gujarat, where long days and mild, sunny winters are ideal for growing processing varieties of potatoes. On top of that, companies invested heavily in cold storage and logistics, making large-scale exports possible and sometimes even offering fries to overseas markets at prices lower than China . This contract farming setup didn’t just change the lives of farmers, but also transformed fortunes of Indian potato processing companies. To put things in perspective, farmers saw their incomes jump by an average of 75% since 2017 and companies started exporting potatoes from being just a domestic supplier earlier. Before this, countries in Southeast Asia, like the Philippines, Thailand, and Indonesia, as well as Middle Eastern markets relied mostly on the US and Europe, especially Belgium and the Netherlands, the world’s top exporters of frozen French fries, for their supply. But with the introduction of special processing potato varieties and contract farming, India became a reliable alternative, supplying French fries to markets that once seemed out of reach. Indian scientists played their part too. The Central Potato Research Institute (CPRI), under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), developed varieties with low sugar and high dry matter — perfect for fries that stay crispy and soak up less oil. Which is also why India’s shipping frozen potato products around the world. And that success sparked a wave of activity. More and more companies set up shop in Gujarat, diving into the manufacturing and sale of processed potatoes. In February this year, Indian frozen fries exports even crossed the 20,000-tonne mark for the first time. And Gujarat has been at the heart of this transformation, producing around 80% of the country’s processed potatoes. So yeah, that’s the fascinating story of how India went from being a net importer of potatoes to a major exporter. And it’ll be exciting to see what happens next. Who knows, the day may not be far when we are neck to neck with large European fries exporters.

https://finshots.in/archive/the-gold-rush-begins-at-home,2025-09-29,Economy,The gold rush begins at home,"29 September 2025 • Economy The gold rush begins at home In today’s Finshots, we talk about how private gold mining might be the first step to reducing India’s reliance on imported gold. But here’s a quick sidenote before we begin: 18% GST on Insurance Is Gone. What Now? Since 22nd September, the 18% GST on insurance premiums has been removed. Policies are now cheaper, but the real question is: which one should you get and how much cover do you actually need? That’s where our 2-day masterclass comes in.

Now, onto today’s story. The Story Indians and gold. It’s a love story that never ends. Whether it’s for weddings, savings, or just as an investment hedge, we can’t get enough of it. And to satisfy this appetite, India imports a thousand tonnes of this yellow metal. Yep, 1000 tonnes of gold every year! But when it comes to producing our own, the number is laughably small at just 1.5 tonnes. Which begs the question - When there’s such a steep demand, why haven’t we mined for gold at home? Well, we have mined in the past. And that’s also part of the reason why we haven’t anymore. Let us explain. The Kolar Gold Field (KGF), once the pride of Indian mining, churned out around 800 tonnes in the 120 years it was active before shutting down in 2001. The reason India stopped mining at KGF was because of a list of concerns. It was active for a long time, and that meant with more gold mined, the next extraction would be deeper. At one point, it was the 2nd deepest gold mine at 3,200 meters depth. And when you have to dig deeper, it costs more to extract gold. Think power costs, ventilation systems, water pumping all adding to the cost of getting the shiny metal out from underneath. And then there’s the environmental hazards that mining caused, especially contaminated water, land and infrastructure. So sure, it was the biggest gold mine of the country at the time, but after a point it was no longer viable. The closest we came to KGF was Hutti Gold Mine which gave us around 84 tonnes of gold between 1947 to 2020. So even if you put both these mines together, they didn’t move the needle. And even with the current active mines, we barely make enough to meet demand. That’s why we’ve been a net importer of gold, buying from around 48 countries. Now you might be wondering, sure, the existing mines have run out of gold or they don’t make enough. So… why not look for more gold reserves? Well, we have looked for them, and even know where they are. Most of the reserves sit in the southern belt of India, and Karnataka alone holds 88% of them. The remaining 12% sit in Andhra Pradesh. But for the longest time, the issue wasn’t where the gold reserves were, it’s how to get to them with the policies behind gold mining. Source: World Gold Council You see, until recently, there hadn’t been any true push for domestic gold mining. Most of the control here is with the government and companies never found it feasible to even bid for mining leases. Why’s that, you ask? Because for decades, mining these reserves was tied up in policy knots. All gold mining operations needed approval from the central government. But the actual licenses were handed out by the state government. There was no transparency nor was it based on competitive bidding. And even if a miner did manage to win the auction, there’s all the approvals that a private company needs: environmental clearances, wildlife approvals, forest clearances and land acquisitions. In short, starting a mine seemed like a paperwork nightmare before a single ounce of gold could be dug up. But all of this changed with the new 2023 Mines and Minerals (Development and Amendment) Bill . It introduced exploration licences (ELs) for private players, letting them scout for critical minerals — gold included — something the 1957 Act never allowed. Auctions were revamped too. Under a new reverse bidding system, exploration companies bid by quoting the smallest share they want from any future mining lease premium. So say if an exploration company discovers a viable gold deposit and the subsequent mining lease auction generates ₹100 crores in premium, the exploration company receives their quoted percentage share. In other words, exploration finally comes with a direct financial incentive. And we’re already seeing the first proof of concept: The Jonnagiri gold project. Located in the same belt as Karnataka’s gold mines, Jonnagiri is part of the East Dharwar craton in the Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh. And it’s run by the Deccan Gold Mines Ltd (DGML), India’s only listed gold exploration/mining company. It’s also the first private gold mine, the first new discovery since Independence, and the first to be developed entirely under the 2023 exploration-license regime. That’s a lot of firsts from one project. And DGML followed through with environmental and land approvals that once kept private players out. In other words, it’s telling that the new policy can actually work. Once it’s fully operational, it could produce 750 kilograms of gold in its first year. Sure, it’s not as large as a thousand tonnes coming in from abroad. But it’s a statement that, this time, the gold rush isn’t at Kolar or Hutti, it’s in the hands of private miners. And when we’ve been producing just 1.5 tonnes, that extra production can boost outputs by 60%! Fun fact:This isn't the first time gold mining came to Jonnagiri. Old debris and pounding marks indicate that the area has been worked by the ancients for recovering gold. These ancient workings led the Geological Survey of India to carry out a detailed investigation in 1991 . But here’s the million-dollar question: Will all of this really reduce our dependence on imported gold? Not immediately. Against annual demand of 800–1,000 tonnes, a few hundred kilos won’t change much. But it’s an important precedent. Because the same policy framework could unlock other critical minerals too. Apart from gold, a total of 107 blocks of minerals were given to state governments for auction, but only 19 were actually auctioned. So the central government took over the mining lease auctions for rhenium, tungsten, cobalt and many other minerals. Faster auctions mean production can start sooner and we can finally see real use of our minerals. And as more private explorers enter the field, new deposits could be discovered and India’s dependence on costly imports could gradually reduce. Until then… Sharing is caring.

https://finshots.in/archive/lying-mirrors-pigeons-ai-and-more,2025-09-28,Sunny Side Up,"Lying mirrors, pigeons & AI, and more…","28 September 2025 • Sunny Side Up Lying mirrors, pigeons & AI, and more… Hey folks! Imagine you’re in a Uniqlo trial room. The mirror tells you the shirt fits like a dream. You buy it, but at home? You have the same shirt, same you… but you look less dashing. Like the magic’s gone. That’s exactly what shoppers in China accused Uniqlo of recently. Social media posts under #UniqloMirror claimed that the brand’s trial room mirrors slimmed waists, softened complexions, even changed how colors looked. Uniqlo denied it, insisting their mirrors are plain vanilla glass. We obviously don’t know who’s right here. But here’s the thing. Stores and brands don’t need fancy tech to shape how you see yourself. Lighting, angles, muted backdrops… every detail is often engineered to make you like what you see. And once you like what you see, you buy. That’s impulse shopping in action. The emotional brain shouts “yes” long before your rational brain can whisper “maybe later”. And brands have always thrived on these nudges. Think of how most lean on urgency: “Only last few left!” Or how a colour suddenly becomes the colour of the year (2025’s is Mocha Mousse , in case you’re wondering). Even brand names are psychology hacks. Like how Lululemon’s founder once admitted he chose the company’s name because it was harder for Japanese consumers to pronounce the letter ‘L’, making it feel exotic. These tricks prey on the same human quirk. That we’re not nearly as rational as we think after all. And impulse purchases aren’t a failure of willpower. They’re more about environments built to exploit those weaknesses. So maybe the real “lying mirror” isn’t in Uniqlo’s showroom at all. Maybe it’s in our heads, reflecting the version of ourselves that shops on instinct. And in an era where every store and every screen is nudging us to do so, a good hack is catching yourself in the act (maybe in front of a mirror itself! :)) It’s super hard to skip these, we know. But it’s also a nice way forward, yeah? To sometimes outsmart your own psychology before it empties your wallet. Here’s a soundtrack to put you in the mood 🎵 This world is a strange place by The Kush Upadhyay Group What caught our eye this week 👀 AI is all thanks to Pigeons?! If you think pigeons are just winged freeloaders squatting on your balcony, think again. Because these birds might have given us the blueprint for artificial intelligence. Yeah, no kidding! Back in the 1950s, a psychologist named B.F. Skinner put pigeons in boxes and trained them with food pellets. If they pecked the right button, they got a reward. But peck the wrong one and they go hungry. And through this simple system of trial and error, pigeons soon learned to perform surprisingly complex tasks. Sidebar: At one point, Skinner even pitched a plan to the US military to use pigeons to guide missiles. And while that sounds nuts, the birds were surprisingly accurate. By the 1990s, scientists noticed something stranger. Pigeons could recognize patterns humans often failed at. Show them a set of photos, and they’d sort trees, or tell a Monet from a Picasso . Because they were brilliant at one thing: relentless learning. Keep pecking, keep failing, keep adjusting. Over and over. Fast forward to today. In a new study , researchers flashed pigeons abstract visuals like lines, rings, odd shapes. At first, they guessed, hitting about half accuracy. But after enough tries, they improved. On easier tasks, they reached 95%. Even on near-impossible ones, they still got better. Now, here’s where the AI connection comes in. The study shows how pigeons’ learning style is nearly identical to how machine learning works. Both pigeons and AI rely on associative learning (linking “this stimulus means that response”) and error correction (“wrong choice? adjust and try again”). There’s no big rulebook, no human-like reasoning. Just repetition until the system gets it right. And this is exactly where humans actually perform badly. We get stuck trying to invent neat rules like “all verticals go left, horizontals go right.” And when no rule fits, we get frustrated and quit after the overthinking lag. Pigeons, however, don’t bother with rules. They just brute-force their way through, mistake after mistake, until they crack it. The researchers even built a simple AI model using the same method — associative learning plus error correction. And its learning curve looked just like the pigeons’. In other words, what we celebrate as cutting-edge intelligence is, as its core, bird brain logic. And if you think that’s the end of their tech story, just remember Nikola Tesla , the man who gave us alternating current and wireless dreams, adored pigeons. He spent hours feeding them, claimed they inspired his thinking, and once said that when his favorite white pigeon died, something went out of his life. So maybe it’s time we give pigeons more credit. The next time one struts past you at a tea stall, don’t dismiss it as a flying rat. You might just be looking at the original neural network, cooing away in plain sight :) Infographic 📊 Readers Recommend 🗒️ This week, our reader Shahzad, recommends reading Investment Biker by Jim Rogers.

And in this week’s Markets edition, we dive into realty firm TCC Concept’s potential acquisition of Pepperfry and explore why a loss-making omnichannel furniture retailer seems to be a bet worth making. Click here to read the full story . With that out of the way, let’s recap what we wrote this week. The Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers IPO explained Brokerage firms often live and die by market moods. And Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers (ARSSBL), which hit the public markets this week, with a ₹745 crore IPO, wants investors to bet on its full-service model from research, advisory, portfolio management, and more. Sure, the timing seems right. Household savings are steadily shifting from deposits to markets, margin trading is growing at breakneck pace, and ARSSBL has clocked a 35% compounded annual growth rate in revenues over the past two years. But dig deeper and you see that discount brokers control nearly 80% of the industry, ARSSBL’s profitability trails peers, and the shadow of the NSEL scam still looms. And to know more about these things, you can check out our Monday’s story . The $100,000 H-1B visa shock Donald Trump slapped a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visas, up from about $1,000. Considering 70% of these visas go to Indians, the shockwaves were instant. The White House insists this is a one-time fee, but the fine print tells a bigger story — agencies have been told to rejig how visas are prioritised and how wages are benchmarked. Which means higher-paid jobs get preference, while entry-level roles could face the heat. And for Indian IT firms, the calculus changes: why pay $100,000 per engineer in the US when you can expand delivery centres out of the US? But for India, that could even be a blessing in disguise like more talent staying back, deeper domestic markets, and global capability centres booming. The question then is does this policy protect American jobs, or push them offshore faster? That’s what we unpack in our Tuesday’s newsletter . The Intel–Nvidia saga For years, Intel was the king of chips. But then came the delays, yield disasters, and a slow erosion of its crown. AMD surged ahead in CPUs, TSMC became the world’s foundry of choice, and Intel turned into a laggard. So why on earth is Nvidia, the hottest AI-chipmaker today, spending $5 billion to take a stake in this wounded rival? The answer is insurance. You see, Nvidia’s entire empire runs on chips made in Taiwan by TSMC, and that’s a geopolitical gamble. By working with Intel, Nvidia gets to diversify supply chains, score political points in the US, and access Intel’s still formidable ecosystem. Intel, meanwhile, gets relevance and the whiff of a turnaround story. But is this partnership a true Plan B, or just another weak link in an already fragile supply chain? You can read our Wednesday’s story here for all the answers. President Trump dislikes quarterly results now? Quarterly earnings are Wall Street’s heartbeat. Every three months, companies release their numbers, analysts read them closely, and share prices swing. But Trump isn’t a fan of this. He says the ritual eats up time and money, and worse, it forces managers to chase short-term results instead of long-term growth. His solution? Scrap quarterly reports altogether and go back to semi-annual updates. Now that sounds simple, but the evidence suggests otherwise. The UK tried it and found that companies didn’t suddenly invest more for the long term. Instead, many kept reporting quarterly anyway just to stay visible. And fewer disclosures could mean more room for insiders to trade on private knowledge, eroding trust in markets. So we study this issue more, and try to make sense of it all in our Thursday newsletter . 10% of Kutch for green energy and data centres = development? Kutch is India’s salt desert, but now it’s turning into the country’s green energy capital. Reliance is pouring ₹75,000 crores into hydrogen and batteries. Adani is building a 30-GW sprawl of solar and wind farms. And between them, they’ve cornered nearly a million acres… or about 10% of the district’s land. On paper, it looks like a clean-energy jackpot. But the story isn’t as shiny. Because Reliance’s hydrogen dream needs pipelines that don’t exist and Adani still carries coal baggage that could spook investors. And the desert’s fragile ecology is at risk — endangered bustards colliding with power lines and thousands of litres of water being guzzled for solar panels. And much of this power could go to the west's data centres. So on paper, Google and Meta look greener, but on the ground, Kutch pays the price. So what’s the way out? That’s something we talk about in our Friday’s story to answer if this is real development, or just a mirage? Liked this wrapup?

The Story In 2011, two friends and ex-eBay colleagues, Ambareesh Murty and Ashish Shah, decided to quit their jobs and chase a bold dream — to revolutionise how Indians bought furniture. And that’s how Pepperfry was born , an online marketplace for furniture and home goods. The launch was an instant hit. On day one alone, they racked up 1,400 orders. And over the next few years, Pepperfry grew rapidly. It wasn’t just an online brand anymore. They launched Studio Pepperfry, physical stores where customers could see and feel the designs before buying. They even dabbled in the franchise model, spreading to 500 cities and opening physical stores in 20 of them. At one point, nearly 40% of their business came from these offline ventures. No wonder they had their eyes set on Tier II and Tier III cities next. But this was all before the pandemic hit. Then came Covid. And surprisingly, it felt like a blessing. People who once used balconies to dry clothes suddenly wanted to convert them into cosy reading corners and chic coffee nooks. Furniture got an upgrade in urban homes, and Pepperfry rode the wave. By 2022, it was one of India’s leading online furniture retailers, valued at over $300 million and backed by big names like Goldman Sachs, Norwest Venture Partners, Bertelsmann India Investments, and even Fevicol-maker Pidilite. Sure, the earnings weren’t great. Revenues stood at about ₹264 crores that year, with losses of nearly ₹194 crores. But the founders were confident. They believed that Pepperfry could soon turn the corner, go profitable, and even hit the stock markets. The company even rebranded itself to Pepperfry Limited to get IPO-ready. But wait before you Google its share price. Because the story’s not quite how you’d expect. The IPO never actually happened. In fact in 2023, Pepperfry shelved its plans after losses barely narrowed by just 3%, despite revenues climbing 10%. And a few days ago, the big twist arrived. Pepperfry signed a term sheet to get acquired. Not by a flashy tech giant or a private equity fund, but by TCC Concept , a small-cap listed real estate company you’ve probably never heard of. The entire buyout is said to happen at a valuation far below the $352 million Pepperfry commanded over a year ago. And many news reports are calling it what it seems to be — a distress sale. So, how did one of India’s hottest online furniture retailers slow down, and end up in the arms of a realty firm? And what does TCC Concept really gain from buying a loss-making furniture player? To understand that, let’s rewind to the time when Pepperfry was still dreaming big about its IPO. Now, it wouldn’t be fair to say that the troubles began during the pandemic. But that period didn’t exactly help either. At the peak of Covid, Pepperfry went all-in on physical expansion. More stores meant more rental expenses. And while the franchise model meant they didn’t have to bear the cost of setting up studios, they still had to handle inventory, assembly, last-mile delivery, and even marketing campaigns for those outlets. The numbers tell the story. Rental expenses jumped from ₹80 lakhs in FY20 to ₹6.8 crores the very next year. That’s a 750% surge at a time when customers were shopping online and avoiding stores. You could call it bad timing or maybe even bad luck. But this “bad luck” streak really began years earlier, almost soon after it took off. Selling furniture has never been an easy business. It’s bulky, needs installation, and isn’t something you can deliver overnight. Logistics is a nightmare. Storage costs can pile up and deliveries can go up to weeks. That’s partly why Pepperfry ventured offline in the first place. By then, though, the competition was already heating up. Urban Ladder, Wakefit, Ikea, Wooden Street, Amazon, Flipkart, and even apparel chains like Westside and Fabindia wanted a piece of India’s furniture market. And suddenly, Pepperfry was just one player in a very crowded room. Then there was customer satisfaction. Buying furniture isn’t like buying clothes. You want things that fit your exact needs. Maybe a cupboard with a solid lock, wheels under a heavy piece for easy moving, or even a secret drawer or two. But Pepperfry didn’t really offer that level of customisation , beyond picking colours. On the other hand, its competitor, Wooden Street, spotted this gap early and leaned hard into customised furniture. It wasn’t the easiest way to scale, but it did win customers. Pepperfry, meanwhile, missed that bus. And in furniture, keeping customers is everything. People don’t buy new sofas every year, so loyalty is key. But instead of adapting to market needs, Pepperfry doubled down on advertising — burning nearly a third of its funding on marketing campaigns. It was almost like a dead investment, bringing back hardly any returns. Add to that the fact that Pepperfry’s price points were premium than competitors like Wakefit, which offered standard designs at lower entry points. For context, while Pepperfry’s best-rated dining tables and sofas started at ₹50,000, Wakefit was offering solid alternatives from ₹30,000. And in a price-sensitive market like India, customers often jump ship for a better deal, even in the urban segment. But just as the company was grappling with these challenges, the most unexpected blow came. The sudden death of Ambareesh Murty in 2023, which triggered a management reshuffle and changes in how the business was run. All of this showed up in the numbers. By FY24, Pepperfry’s revenues had slumped to ₹209 crores , a 40% drop from the previous year. Losses narrowed, but only because they cut back hard on employee costs and marketing spends. Which brings us to the last piece of the puzzle — What does Pepperfry even bring to the table for TCC Concept? And who on earth is this company? Well, TCC Concept wasn’t even in real estate to begin with. Until 2023, it was a cotton textile trading firm called Aaswa Trading and Exports Limited . And if you peek at its books back then, the numbers looked tiny. In FY23, it clocked operating revenues of just ₹1.2 crores . Profits, funnily enough, were a hefty slice of that at ₹81 lakhs, giving it eye-popping operating profit margins of 91%! Then suddenly, the very next year, revenues shot up to ₹77 crores and profits ballooned to ₹20 crores. That looked strange. So we dug into the annual reports and found out that the name change wasn’t just cosmetic. FY24 was the first full year that TCC Concept included the results of its subsidiaries — Brantford India, which offers flexible office spaces, and Altrr Software Solutions, which helps real estate players generate leads, engage customers, and make data-driven decisions. These new-age businesses opened up revenue streams that didn’t even exist a year earlier like data centre leasing and AI-powered digital services. So the company had quietly pivoted into high-growth markets. And that tells you what TCC Concept is really chasing. It wants to grab every fast-growing segment it can get its hands on. Like India’s furniture market that’s projected to grow at a solid 15% each year, climbing from $1.6 billion today to nearly $5.5 billion by 2033. This surge is being driven by a mix of urbanisation, rising disposable incomes, more people shopping online, and the convenience of e-commerce platforms that promise variety and personalisation at the click of a button. And yeah, buying Pepperfry, likely at a bargain price, could help it stitch together real estate and furniture marketplaces, sectors that actually complement each other. Just think about it. Cross-selling property and home furnishings, sharing warehouses and logistics, tapping into Pepperfry’s customer base. And if you add TCC’s AI-driven tech platforms into the mix, it could even boost Pepperfry’s supply chain and customer experience. On paper, at least, it looks like a neat fit. What’s worrying, though, is that TCC Concept’s stock barely trades . Low trading volumes mean low liquidity, and that’s never a great sign. Add to that its sudden foray into multiple sectors, and the business model starts to look a bit fuzzy. So things could go upwards or downwards from here. Sure, TCC Concept’s stock has been climbing since the news of its intention to acquire Pepperfry, but whether this move can really turn the tables for the furniture retailer or not, is something only time will tell.

https://finshots.in/archive/10-of-kutch-for-green-energy-and-data-centres-development-reliance-adani-solar-land,2025-09-26,Economy,10% of Kutch for green energy and data centres = development?,"26 September 2025 • Economy 10% of Kutch for green energy and data centres = development? In today’s Finshots, we tell you how India’s richest men are turning a salt desert into the world’s biggest clean energy hub. And why the story may not be as clean as it sounds. The Story Kutch is a land most Indians don’t think about. But almost every Indian depends on it. Why? Because nearly three-quarters of the country’s salt comes from here. That’s thanks to an odd history. In 1819, a massive earthquake cut Kutch off from the Arabian Sea. The sea receded, shallow plains formed, and each monsoon they flooded before evaporating into blinding sheets of salt. Over generations, people adapted. But the very geography that produced salt also stalled development. The summers scorch, the monsoons flood, the soil is poor, and the remoteness meant little industry took root. Until now. Because if you have 320 sunny days a year, some of India’s highest solar radiation (5.5–6 kWh/m²/day), and steady coastal winds, you don’t just have a desert. You have a renewable energy jackpot. And you can turn it into one of the best renewable corridors in the country. So it’s no surprise then that India’s richest men have staked their claims. Together, Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani have acquired close to 550,000 acres and 460,000 acres here, respectively. Yep, that’s close to a million acres! Or about 8–10% of the district’s total area. Reliance is pouring 75,000 crores here as it wants to build what it calls a “fully integrated new energy ecosystem”. The idea is to have 20 GW of solar modules, 40 GWh of batteries, and 3 million tonnes of green hydrogen annually by 2032. So the idea is to control not just power plants, but the very molecules of tomorrow. Adani, meanwhile, is going for brute scale. At Khavda, on the India–Pakistan border, his group is building a 30-GW sprawl of solar and wind farms, backed by long-term power agreements and a private transmission network. On paper, their strategies look different. Reliance wants to turn sunlight into hydrogen and batteries. Adani wants to flood the grid with electrons. But in practice, they’re stepping on each other’s toes. Because both need factories, both are capturing vast tracts of land, both need transmission lines, and both are chasing the same government incentives. Which means this is a race for control over India’s green future. But what looks like a jackpot on paper carries risks when you zoom out to the industry level. For one, there’s the danger of consolidation. Analysts at Bernstein warn that if Reliance and Adani execute their plans, they could control half of India’s wafer manufacturing and up to 90% of polysilicon capacity. Which means smaller players like Waaree and Premier Energies might survive, but they’ll struggle to keep up. Then there are hurdles at company levels. Start with Reliance. Its grand hydrogen vision only works if it can actually move that hydrogen. But pipelines are years away, making transport costly and inefficient. Worse, it has only 3 GW of grid connectivity mapped till 2030. So unless it acquires transmission assets or finds a workaround, its gleaming gigafactories risk sitting idle. Adani, meanwhile, carries coal baggage. His group remains one of India’s biggest coal producers, and the controversial Carmichael mine in Australia still ships fuel abroad. For global investors, that creates a credibility gap: is this a pivot, or just green icing on a black cake? Then there’s the danger of overbuild. While India’s renewable push is massive, the transmission grid still leans heavily ( 74% ) on coal for stability. And storage solutions like batteries or pumped hydro are expensive. So if capacity in Kutch outpaces demand or evacuation lines, you end up with stranded assets. And finally, economics. Green hydrogen is still 2–3x costlier than fossil hydrogen, and looks viable only because of subsidies. And for Adani, margins depend on locking in big power agreements… but states are moving toward auctions that drive tariffs down. And hovering over both groups is the spectre of monopoly power. If two conglomerates corner wafers, polysilicon, and transmission, the sector risks becoming a closed shop, leaving India’s green transition overly dependent on them. And this risk has been flagged by the Indian Army too. Take Adani’s land, for instance. Khavda sits right on the Pakistan border, once off-limits under Defence Ministry rules. But the buffer was cut from 10 km to 1 km, and land earlier held by SECI, the government’s solar agency, was reallocated to Adani’s subsidiaries. And SECI had no idea about the development Adani was going to carry on this land. In effect, one of India’s most sensitive frontiers turned into a private energy park. Reliance’s history isn’t spotless either. Its Jamnagar complex sits on the Gulf of Kutch, tagged an ecologically critical zone. Yet pipelines and desalination plants were cleared despite warnings about risks to corals and mangroves. Which means when these companies pitch a “green revolution” in Kutch, they do so on a history of rules bent, audits ignored, and exceptions normalised. And if you think that’s a lot of damage, wait until you hear about the ecology risks and communities at stake this green revolution brings. Take the Great Indian Bustard . The critically endangered bird often collides with power lines across its habitats. The Supreme Court has ordered lines to be sent underground, but the process is slow and developers keep lobbying for exceptions. Move further in and you hit the Banni grasslands, one of Asia’s largest. Maldhari pastoralists graze camels and buffalo here. But once laced with transmission corridors and fences, the common areas shrink into fragments. For the community, it feels like being nudged out of their own home. And then there’s water — the desert’s cruel irony. Every megawatt of solar panels can gulp thousands of litres . Scale that to tens of gigawatts and you get billions of litres in one of India’s driest regions. The final irony is that much of this green energy is for Google and Meta’s data centres. On paper, Silicon Valley cuts its carbon footprint. In practice, the land, water, and ecological costs sit in Kutch. But none of this means Kutch can’t host the green revolution. It very well can. It just has to be built differently. The first step is corridor discipline. Power lines today pop up wherever projects demand, slicing through bustard habitats and grazing lands. Instead, Gujarat and the Centre need mapped corridors that avoid sensitive zones. Second, cumulative assessments. Clearances today treat each solar park as if it exists alone . But zone-level studies that add up bird deaths, water stress, and land loss, and make the data public, are critical. Third, commons and consent. The Banni grasslands aren’t wastelands but community resources. So recognising grazing rights or structured leases with revenue-sharing can turn them into partners instead of collateral damage. Fourth, water neutrality. Hydrogen and solar could consume billions of litres if unchecked. So robotic cleaning, closed-loop washing, and strict audits must be mandatory. And finally, transparency. As we saw, border rules and coastal buffers were bent quietly for private companies. The rationale and safeguards should be published, with sunset clauses. So yeah, the stakes aren’t just local. India is betting its $1 trillion-plus clean energy future on deserts like Kutch. It wants 500 GW of renewables by 2030, and investors see these projects as proof India can power AI data centres and hydrogen exports without coal. In that sense, Kutch is a test case. Whether the transition will be fast and fair, or whether speed will come at the cost of sustainability. Which brings us back to the desert duel. On paper, both Reliance and Adani could win. But neither wins if the land itself loses. So tell us. If the price of the future is turning a living desert into an industrial one… is it development? Until then… Sharing is caring.

In today’s Finshots, we talk about why US President Donald Trump wants public companies to stop reporting quarterly results. But here’s a quick sidenote before we begin. We’re gathering real reviews for Health & Term Insurance policies to feature on the Ditto Insurance website, and we’d love your help! It’ll only take a minute or two: • Click here for Health Insurance • Or here for Term Insurance P.S. Your review might just make it to our policy pages. Thanks for helping us out! Now, onto today’s story. The Story Trump loves making headlines. And this week, he’s been in the news so much that we couldn’t resist doing another story about him or rather about his issue with companies having to file quarterly earnings reports. Now, if you’ve ever wondered what these reports are, think of them as a business’ report card that comes out every three months. They’re not fully audited, but they give a pretty clear snapshot of sales, expenses, profits and even cash flow. Investors and analysts rely on them to see how a company’s doing, compare results with previous quarters, and decide where to put their money. In short, these reports can move share prices, shape investment strategies, and even guide management decisions. But here’s a fun fact. Quarterly results weren’t always a thing. Until 1970 , American companies only had to report twice a year. They would submit an annual report called Form 10-K, which contained audited numbers, and a semi-annual update. That’s it. Then the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), the US’ market regulator, decided that companies should share updates more often, for the sake of transparency. And things got even stricter after the early 2000s corporate scandals. Remember Enron? That’s when the US Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (in 2002). It made CEOs and CFOs personally sign off on financial statements, including the quarterly Form 10-Q, to reassure investors that the numbers weren’t cooked. Trump, however, isn’t a fan of all this. He argues that the process is expensive and that it pushes managers to obsess over short-term results rather than long-term growth. So his quick fix is to scrap the quarterly ritual and go back to semi-annual reporting instead. Source: Donald J. Trump, Truth Social And honestly, Trump’s point might not be entirely off the mark. You see, preparing quarterly results is no easy feat. Companies can spend nearly a month and a half just putting the numbers together, which means that by the time they’re done, they’re already halfway into the next quarter. Add to that the endless cycle of earnings calls (those conference calls where a company’s management walks analysts, investors, and the media through its results), updating guidance (basically telling investors what profits and revenues to expect next), and media appearances. For small listed firms, all this compliance chews up around 853 hours and a hefty chunk of money every year. Time and money that could probably be better spent actually running the business, or investing in projects that pay off in the long run. And then there’s the bigger issue of ‘ short-termism ’. When companies report every quarter, managers often start chasing short-term targets at the expense of long-term strategy. Why? Because in those earnings calls, they set guidance for the next quarter. If they miss those expectations, the stock price can take a hit. Investors could panic and managers could lose out on bonuses tied to those targets. So they end up doing whatever it takes to hit the numbers, even if it’s not great for the company down the road. For instance, in the pharmaceutical industry, a company might cut back on R&D (research and development) spending right before results to make profits look better. Sure, that keeps investors and analysts happy in the short run. But it also means fewer new drugs in the pipeline, weaker patents, and lost market share in the future. And that can be a risky approach. But while these are the practical reasons why Trump thinks companies should stop quarterly earnings reporting, the real reason might be something else — the fact that the number of publicly traded companies in the US has been shrinking dramatically. To put things in perspective, back in 1996, there were nearly 8,090 of them . But that number dropped to 3,952 by the end of 2024. Even the Wilshire 5000 index, which was supposed to track all American stocks actively traded in the US, when it launched in 1974, now has only about 3,600. If you’re wondering why, well, part of it is consolidation or big companies acquiring smaller ones. But another big factor is regulation. Laws like Sarbanes-Oxley and the rising cost of compliance have made life harder for smaller firms. And that meant many chose to delist, while others simply avoided going public in the first place. And that’s where Trump steps in. He wants to reverse this trend by encouraging more companies, especially startups and small firms, to list on public markets. His pitch is simple. Smaller publicly listed companies create jobs, attract capital, and boost economic growth. The more of them, the better. So, in his view, one way to make public markets more attractive is to ditch quarterly reporting, cut down compliance costs, ease the regulatory burden, and free companies from the constant treadmill of short-term targets. But then this isn’t the first time that Trump has floated such an idea. During his first term in 2018, he even asked the SEC to explore whether companies could switch from quarterly updates to half-yearly ones. But back then, the SEC didn’t think it was a good idea. And that’s probably because it saw a few problems with reducing the frequency of earnings reports. To begin with, fewer reports might ease compliance pressure for companies, but it’s not great for investors. Just think about it. The longer the gap between reports, the less information outsiders have compared to insiders like employees, managers and executives. That creates what’s called “information asymmetry”. And it gives insiders a bigger window or an extra three months , to exploit private knowledge, trade stocks, or profit unfairly. Over time, that erodes investor trust. Less trust means less capital flowing into companies. Less transparency means more uncertainty. And uncertainty usually pushes share prices down. The SEC also had another case study to look at — the UK. Because the US isn’t the only country that’s thinking about moving to semi-annual earnings reporting. There are other countries that already do this. Source: Wall Street Horizon The UK, for example, introduced mandatory quarterly reporting in 2007. But a Columbia study later found that the move didn’t really change how firms invested. Long-term spending on R&D, capital projects, and other growth initiatives stayed the same. And when the UK regulator rolled back the rule in 2014 , expecting companies to suddenly invest more, that didn’t happen either. On the flip side, something even more interesting happened. Even without the rule, most UK companies, over 90%, kept reporting quarterly anyway, because they didn’t want investors to think that they were hiding something. But those that stopped quarterly updates found themselves fading into the background. Analysts stopped covering them, and visibility dropped. And in the markets, out of sight often means out of mind. And then there’s the question of cost savings. Sure, companies do spend time and money preparing quarterly reports. But studies suggest the actual savings from scrapping them would be modest — about $330,000 a year in legal and compliance costs for a small firm, which is just 0.2% of median revenues. That’s hardly a game-changer. Put all this together, and you’ll see why reporting quarterly or semi-annually doesn't really change long-term business decisions. What it does affect, however, is how visible you are to investors. And maybe that’s why the SEC, back in 2018, wasn’t buying Trump’s argument. Because if the UK is anything to go by, fewer reports don’t necessarily mean stronger markets or more listings. In fact, even with semi-annual reporting, the UK still struggles to attract fresh IPOs, or to hold on to the companies it already has. The proof is in the pudding. Fundraising from London IPOs in the first half of 2025 dropped to its lowest level since 1995. Only five companies made their market debut in those six months, raising a total of just £160 million. So yeah, maybe this is something the Trump administration shouldn’t overlook, especially now that it’s asked the SEC to make this proposal a priority. If anything, it might want to scrap quarterly earnings guidance instead. Because that’s the real villain pushing companies to chase short-term results. But ditching quarterly results altogether, could be like throwing the baby out with the bathwater. And if, in the quest to Make America Great Again, things go sideways, well… it could get very messy. And that would be… ‘Not good!!!’. Until then… If this story helped you understand Trump’s psychology behind scrapping quarterly results and you learnt something new, why not share it with your friends, family, or even strangers on WhatsApp , LinkedIn , or X ? After all, it’s always nicer to have a smarter bunch of folks around you.",1524,7.62,61.34,0.467,"companies, quarterly, trump, results, term, even, reporting, investors","President Trump, President Donald Trump, Capital Markets, Classic Legends, Ditto Insurance, Term Insurance"

The Story On paper, India is a banker’s dream. Over half the population is young, eager to spend, borrow, and invest. That should mean crores of bank accounts, credit cards, car loans, and home loans. But, one by one, the world’s biggest foreign banks, once desperate for a slice of this pie, are quietly shutting shop. Citibank sold its consumer banking arm to Axis Bank for ₹11,603 crores in 2023. FirstRand gave up after 12 years of trying. Standard Chartered offloaded a ₹4,100 crore loan book to Kotak Mahindra last year. And most recently, Deutsche Bank has invited bids for its retail business. Domestic banks, on the other hand, are thriving. They’ve been expanding branches, growing deposits, and buying up the very business that foreign banks are exiting. Take SBI, the largest bank, for instance. It posted a record ₹70,901 crores in FY25 profits. HDFC Bank, the private sector giant, wasn’t far behind at ₹67,347 crores . Clearly, retail banking works in India, and the problem wasn’t a lack of opportunity. So why exactly couldn’t foreign banks crack it? After all, they come better equipped with capital, experience and a diversified business. Well, the answer lies in the basics of retail banking in India. And it’s quite literally a numbers game. You need millions of customers, thousands of branches spread across the country, and a steady inflow of low-cost deposits from everyday salary and savings accounts. That’s where Indian giants dominate. HDFC Bank runs over 9,000 branches , while SBI dwarfs everyone with over 22,000 branches. This scale pulls in lakhs of crores in low-cost retail deposits, which can then be lent profitably. Now compare that with foreign banks. Citi had just 35 branches before its exit. Deutsche Bank still runs only 17. With so little reach, they can’t attract retail deposits cheaply. That forces them to depend on costlier wholesale funding, which eats into margins and again leaves little room to compete in the retail space. And the numbers say that. Deutsche Bank earned ₹12,415 crores in operating income in FY25, but nearly 25% of it vanished in expenses. Standard Chartered’s income of ₹19,938 crores saw 45% wiped out by costs — ₹2,000 crores of it just on staff. When Axis Bank took over Citi’s operations in 2023, it projected 30–40% savings from Citi’s bloated cost base. In short, without scale, the math just never worked. Another piece of the puzzle is something called Net Interest Margin, or NIM. Think of it as the profit a bank makes on every rupee it lends. Imagine your bank pays you 6% interest on your savings but lends that same money at 12%. The 6% difference is the spread, or NIM—the bank’s core profit from lending. And essentially, NIM shows how efficiently a bank turns deposits into profit. So if a bank reports a NIM of 6%, it earns ₹6 for every ₹100 it lends. But that ₹6 still has to cover salaries, branch costs, and bad loans, so the actual profit is much smaller. For Indian giants, NIM usually hovers around 3–4%. Kotak Bank has even pushed it up to 4.6% in recent quarters. That may not sound like much, but because these banks operate at massive scale, it translates into eye-popping profits. Now here’s the thing. Foreign banks actually post similar or even higher NIMs. Deutsche Bank reported 4.9% and Standard Chartered 4.6% in FY25. Sounds good, no? Well, not quite. Because once you factor in their costs, the picture changes fast. Deutsche Bank, for instance, spent over ₹3,100 crores on operating expenses in FY25, leaving just ₹3,931 crores in net profit. Standard Chartered burned through nearly ₹8,900 crores in expenses, bringing its net profit down to ₹7,089 crores. All that says that while the margins on paper look fine, the lack of scale means expenses chew up most of the profits. And with just a handful of branches to spread costs across, foreign banks simply can’t turn deposits into profits as efficiently as Indian banks with their massive retail networks. Next, there’s the structure of banking in India. You see, the rulebook looks different if a bank isn’t based here. To scale retail operations, RBI requires foreign banks to switch to a wholly-owned subsidiary model. This makes scaling through the branch model complicated. Since it means tying up ₹3 billion in capital, overhauling governance with Indian directors, and navigating through new compliance. Back in 2021 , even Deutsche Bank’s India head pointed out that the subsidiary model offered them little benefit. With that being said, foreign banks don’t leave India because of retail competition alone. Sometimes they do it as part of their global strategy. Citibank’s India exit was part of a wider exit, leaving 14 markets in total including China, Australia and South Korea. This was to focus more on their institutional banking and wealth management segments. Standard Chartered chose to focus more on wealth solutions. Their wealth management made $694 million last year after growing by 32% . Even Deutsche Bank announced 2,000 job cuts in its retail arm globally before news of a sale surfaced. So while foreign banks walk away from retail, they aren’t walking out of India entirely. They still run wholesale, institutional, and wealth businesses. And there is a consolation to these exits since they create big opportunities for Indian banks. Those assets and customers foreign banks acquired are still valuable to the banking industry. So it’s not like they are walking out empty handed. Rather, they get to sell it to the only other parties who can buy their business and are well placed to grow it. Axis Bank gained 2.4 million customers and 1.8 million credit cards from Citi, Kotak picked up Standard Chartered’s loan book, and while Deutsche Bank doesn’t have a buyer yet, we can assume that it could be a bank with deep pockets. So yeah, foreign banks came in with global capital and decades of experience. But it was India’s domestic lenders who built the branches, wooed the deposits, and cracked the scale that retail banking demands. And maybe that goes to show that our homegrown banks understand India best when it comes to retail banking. Until then… Don’t forget to share this story on WhatsApp , LinkedIn and X .

Now, onto today’s story. The Story Before we get into the actual story, here’s a little analogy that will help: Did you know that white tea and green tea come from the same plant? However, white tea costs as much as ₹10,000 for a kilogram. It consists of the finest and the most tender of leaves, processed with the utmost care, and hand-plucked just before dawn. You miss this opportunity, and you will still get tea, just not the ‘best’ kind. And the price comes down from ₹10,000 per KG to, say, a few hundred rupees per kilogram. Computer processors are just like that. Processors like Intel’s i3, i5, i7, or i9 often come from similar semiconductor wafers. What matters is yield: chips that fail to meet the specifications (for the number of cores, cache, speed, power, etc.) may be classified into lower‑tier models. Larger, more demanding designs have a higher chance of defect, so fewer make it as i9‑class chips and may be reduced to a lower class. And that’s kind of where Intel’s troubles began. As rivals like TSMC (the Taiwan chip giant) had excellent yields from their wafers, Intel stumbled. Its most advanced manufacturing nodes delivered poor yields. Too many errors. Too much wastage. And slowly, what was once the gold standard of chipmaking began falling behind , and Intel’s leadership in foundry technology eroded by 2015. By 2021, Intel even outsourced GPU (graphic processing unit) production to TSMC due to ‘internal yield concerns’. Simply put, this is where a tech company faces manufacturing problems in the sense that the % of functional and defect-free products is lower than expected. As the years passed, the cracks widened. Intel’s foundry business became a money drain. Its CPUs lost the performance crown to the US tech giant AMD. And its most ambitious chip designs faced delay after delay. So much so that in a world increasingly dependent on silicon, the OG chipmaking giant looked like it was being left behind. And eventually, investors lost confidence. Until a couple of weeks ago. That’s when the US government announced that it would acquire a 10% non-voting stake in Intel, backed by a funding commitment of $8.9 billion. A signal, perhaps, that Washington still sees Intel as a strategic asset worth saving. And now, Nvidia is making its move too – it has agreed to buy roughly a 4% stake in Intel, valued at around $5 billion. What’s interesting here is that Intel is going to manufacture custom chips for Nvidia’s data-centre platforms, as well as personal computer GPUs. Nvidia will knit the pieces together with NVLink, its high-speed interconnect, so the CPUs can feed GPUs faster and juggle AI workloads more efficiently. But here’s the big question: Why would Nvidia, the market leader in GPUs, invest in a struggling rival like Intel? The answer is basically less dependence on TSMC. The vast majority of Nvidia’s advanced chips are made in Taiwan by TSMC. That’s terrific while geopolitics behaves, but terrifying when it doesn’t. And Nvidia needs a Plan B. That’s where Intel steps in. Sure, Intel can’t match TSMC on cutting-edge yield or node maturity. But it still has world-class expertise in x86 chips (chips like Pentium and Core) manufacturing, packaging, and testing. It’s one of the most widely used chips in laptops today. So these are areas that Nvidia can tap into without compromising too much on quality. There’s also the political upside here. By working with Intel, Nvidia cuts some of its reliance on Taiwan and brings part of its supply chain closer to the US. That helps it dodge steep tariffs and soften the blow from China’s new GPU bans. In short, it’s Nvidia making sure it’s not putting all its eggs in one basket. And that brings us to the real meat of the deal. This partnership is two-pronged. For data centers, Intel will build Nvidia’s custom x86 CPUs that Nvidia can integrate into its AI infrastructure platforms and offer to the market. For personal computing, Intel will build and offer to the market x86 chips (SoCs) with Nvidia’s RTX chiplets, powering a wide range of PCs that demand top-tier CPU–GPU integration. Sure, these are not the highest-end chips that Nvidia makes, but it gets access to Intel’s vast x86 ecosystem, which Intel still has a strong hold on. But mind you, this is easier said than done. Because Intel will still need to prove that it can deliver chips on time, at scale, and without yield disasters. And the chips it’s making for Nvidia aren’t going to be the bleeding-edge AI GPUs that TSMC currently churns out. So no, this isn’t a turnaround moment. Add to this, Intel’s financial troubles haven’t exactly gone away. In FY24, the company posted massive losses of almost $19 billion ! And things didn’t improve in Q1FY25 either. The company still bleeds money. While rivals like TSMC have mastered advanced chip production with excellent yields and tight timelines, Intel is still grappling with consistency. Its manufacturing delays have become infamous, and its cost structure doesn’t quite allow for the kind of aggressive pricing the market now expects. In the meantime, AMD has gained ground in the personal computer race, offering better value-for-money chips and snapping up market share. That double whammy of foundry failure and market erosion has left Intel in a tough spot, which is why this Nvidia deal matters. It’s not a miracle fix. But it’s the first sign of confidence from Silicon Valley in a while. And it’s not just Nvidia or the government betting on Intel. Investors seem to think this might be the beginning of a slow crawl back. The market reacted swiftly to the announcement, Intel’s stock jumped 22% in a day, the sharpest rally it’s seen in years. AMD, on the other hand, saw its stock fall by 5% . Maybe that’s a sign that investors believe this alliance could tilt the scales, even if slightly. So, we’re unlikely to see Intel manufacturing Nvidia’s most powerful AI chips anytime soon, those still belong to TSMC’s cutting-edge fabs. However, this partnership gives both companies something they need. For Nvidia, it’s risk mitigation. For Intel, it’s relevance. And sometimes, that’s all a company needs to stay in the game. But tell us what you think: Could this be the start of Intel clawing its way back to the glory days? Or does it simply add one more weak link to an already fragile supply chain?

https://finshots.in/archive/the-anand-rathi-share-and-stock-brokers-ipo-explained-2,2025-09-22,Capital Markets,The Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers IPO explained,"22 September 2025 • Capital Markets The Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers IPO explained In today’s Finshots, we break down the Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers IPO, which opens for subscription tomorrow (September 23rd) and closes on September 25th. But here’s a quick sidenote before we begin. We’re gathering real reviews for Health & Term Insurance policies to feature on the Ditto Insurance website, and we’d love your help! It’ll only take a minute or two: • Click here for Health Insurance • Or here for Term Insurance P.S. Your review might just make it to our policy pages. Thanks for helping us out! Now, onto today’s story. The Story There isn’t a dramatic backstory to how the Anand Rathi Group came into being. No lightbulb moment, no grand vision scribbled on a napkin. It was simply founded in 1994 , at a time when India was riding the fresh wave of economic liberalisation. Mr. Anand Rathi and Mr. Pradeep Kumar Gupta spotted the financial optimism sweeping through the country and decided to jump right in. Within a year, they had set up a research desk empanelled with major institutional investors and even launched their investment banking business. Over time, the group kept widening its scope from wealth management (the arm that went public in 2021) to insurance broking, real estate services, reinsurance, and capital market lending. But if you had to cut through that long list and sum it up in one line, you’d just say that Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers (ARSSBL), part of the group, is essentially a full-service brokerage house. And it makes money in two big ways. First, there’s the broking segment — contributing about 60% of revenue, where it earns by servicing clients in equities, derivatives, commodities, and currency markets. Then there’s the non-broking segment, about 23% of revenue, which comes from margin trading, portfolio management, and distributing investment products like mutual funds and alternative funds. The rest comes from “other income”. Things like interest from deposits, bonds, and other financial assets. Put it all together and ARSSBL clocked ₹847 crores in revenue in FY25, up 24% from the previous year, growing at a strong 35% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) over the past two years. And it believes there’s more fuel in the tank. That’s because household savings in India are steadily shifting towards the capital markets. Back in FY12, Indians parked 56% of their savings in bank deposits and barely 2% in the markets. Today, deposits have slipped to 46% while capital market investments are up to 9%, largely in mutual funds. And that’s hardly surprising. The economy is expanding, people are becoming more financially aware, and younger investors don’t want to settle for “boring” fixed deposits anymore. They’ve seen the market’s steady returns and want a slice of it. Yet, only 4–5% of India’s population actively trades stocks. Compare that with 55% in the US, 33% in the UK, and 13% in China and that gap leaves plenty of headroom for growth. ARSSBL wants to tap into this by doubling down on its Margin Trading Facility (MTF) business — a service that lets investors buy stocks by paying just part of the cost, with the broker funding the rest like a loan. It’s a sticky product that can consolidate a client’s investments and boost revenues per client. And the overall segment itself has been growing fast in India, at a whopping 87% CAGR since FY20 to reach ₹8,790 crores in FY24. On top of that, ARSSBL intends to expand its footprint. It already runs 90 branches across 54 cities, works with 1,125 agents in 290 cities, and serves 8.8 lakh clients. But to fuel more growth, it needs capital. That’s where its upcoming IPO comes in. It’s a ₹745 crore fresh issue and around ₹550 crores will go towards working capital, with the rest earmarked for general corporate purposes. But should you trust ARSSBL with your money and back its expansion by investing in this IPO? To figure that out, you have to look at the industry itself. The broking industry in India is split between full-service players like ARSSBL and discount brokers like Zerodha*, Groww, Upstox, and others. Full-service brokers offer the whole package — advisory, research, tax planning, estate planning, while discount brokers focus purely on executing trades at rock-bottom costs. And the winds are blowing in favour of discount brokers. Their low, flat fees have opened the doors for millions of retail and institutional investors. And today, discount brokers command 78% of the market, leaving full-service players like ARSSBL with just 22%. And among these, there are five listed brokers that can give you a sense of where ARSSBL stands. Think of the heavyweights like Motilal Oswal Financial Services, Angel One, IIFL Capital Services, and Geojit Financial Services — in that order of income. For context, Motilal Oswal clocked in a massive ₹4,200 crores in total income, nearly five times ARSSBL’s figure. Geojit, on the other hand, brought in about ₹450 crores or half of what ARSSBL did. That puts ARSSBL somewhere in the middle of the pack, sitting at the fourth spot. But when you look at profitability, the picture isn’t flattering. The listed peers boast average EBITDA (operating profit) margins of 43% and PAT (net profit) margins of 26%. But ARSSBL’s are just 37% and 12%, respectively. And the balance sheet isn’t all that comforting either. Its debt-to-equity ratio is 1.8 times, while most others (except Motilal Oswal) sit comfortably below 1. The only saving grace is ROCE (return on capital employed) — a measure of how profitably a company uses the money invested in it, which, at 21%, matches the industry average. And if you dig into the Red Herring Prospectus (RHP) even further, the reasons to invest boil down to one big point: that Anand Rathi is a trusted brand that’s been around for three decades. Beyond that, the risks begin to stack up. To begin with, there are 25 criminal proceedings hanging over the company, its promoters, and directors. These include cases of cheating , forgery, and unauthorised transactions in client accounts, with promises of “guaranteed” returns. And the darkest shadow of them all is the NSEL scam . For context, back in 2013 the National Spot Exchange Limited (NSEL), a commodities trading platform, came crashing down after a colossal payment default of nearly ₹5,600 crores. The government had given NSEL special permission to run one-day forward contracts — essentially, quick agreements to buy or sell something today and settle the deal tomorrow. The idea was to make commodity trading smoother and more liquid, helping farmers and traders. But instead of genuine trading, these contracts morphed into financing schemes dressed up as safe, guaranteed-return investments. Roughly 13,000 clients were roped in, many allegedly misled by brokers. Investigations later revealed that some brokers, including Anand Rathi Commodities Ltd. (part of the group), mis-sold NSEL contracts by promising risk-free returns. It didn’t end there. There were accusations of brokers manipulating client data, issuing fake warehouse receipts, and creating sham trades to make the system look legitimate. But when investors demanded actual delivery of commodities, they discovered that the goods were either missing or had been quietly moved out of warehouses without the regulator’s knowledge. That’s when the house of cards collapsed, leaving investors with massive losses. And the matter is far from buried. Just a few months ago, the Bombay High Court upheld a special court’s order to continue trials and include Anand Rathi Financial Services in the case, alongside IIFL and Geojit Comtrade’s directors. This history also clouds ARSSBL’s future. Take commodities, for example. ARSSBL had applied to SEBI for a licence to act as a commodity derivatives broker. But SEBI rejected it, citing the ongoing NSEL-related investigations. To make things worse, the regulator barred the company from reapplying for six months starting November 2022, or until it’s acquitted. That delays ARSSBL’s ability to tap into a promising segment that had an overall industry turnover of ₹60 crores in FY25, growing at a healthy 44% CAGR over the last five years. Then there’s the issue of pledged promoter shares. Pledging shares is when a shareholder uses their shares as collateral to borrow money — usually from a bank or financial institution. In this case, about 30% of the company’s equity is pledged against secured debentures with Axis Trustee Services. Typically, pledging above 10% is something to watch out for. If the loan terms aren’t met, or if the value of the shares dip and the promoters can’t pledge more, lenders may sell off the shares. And such sell-offs usually spook the market. And finally, let’s not forget valuations. At the upper IPO price band of ₹414, ARSSBL is valued at about four times its revenues. While that might seem reasonable, its P/E (price to earnings) ratio or what you pay for every rupee the company earns, is 18–20x . That’s at par with leaders like Motilal Oswal and Angel One, and with the industry average of 20. In other words, it’s not cheap. The silver lining though is that the IPO proceeds will go directly into the company, not the promoters’ pockets. Their stake will come down from 98% to about 69%, which means they’ll still wield control but are also showing skin in the game. So yeah, if you’re thinking of giving ARSSBL a shot, don’t go expecting quick, magical returns. What you should do is keep a sharp eye on the risks we just mentioned. Because in the end, a brand name is only as strong as the trust it commands.

Hey folks! Two Indian engineers, Vikash Kumar and Sarthak Mittal, just bagged the Ig Nobel Prize in Engineering Design. Wait… isn’t the Nobel Prize 2025 announcement still a couple of weeks away? Yup, it is. But notice we said Ig Nobel, and not Nobel. So what’s the Ig Nobel, you ask? Think of it as the Nobel’s cheeky cousin. It’s a satirical prize set up in 1991 by Marc Abrahams, editor of the Annals of Improbable Research, to honour research that first makes you laugh, then makes you think. Hence the name “Ig Nobel” as a play on the word “ignoble”. And this year’s winners definitely live up to that brief. The Ig in Psychology went to a study on what happens when you tell narcissists, or just anyone, that they’re intelligent. The Ig in Nutrition went to research on which pizza toppings rainbow lizards prefer. The Ig in Biology went to a bunch of Japanese scientists who found that cows painted with zebra-like stripes were less likely to be bitten by flies. And the Ig in Peace, to research showing that a little alcohol can actually improve your pronunciation in a newly learned foreign language. Oh, and in case you’re wondering about the findings: yes, just being told that you’re smart, whether it’s true or not can make you more narcissistic, zebra-painted cows got nearly 50% fewer fly bites, rainbow lizards at a resort in Togo love four-cheese pizza, and booze may help improve the pronunciation of people who newly learn a foreign language. The list is long, but let’s get to the main one. What did our Indian engineers win for? Their research looked at how foul-smelling shoes ruin the otherwise pleasant experience of using a shoe rack. Quirky? Absolutely. And prize-worthy? You bet. But while the Igs celebrate funny and unusual studies, the winners are serious researchers — professors, scientists, and yes, even engineers. In fact, the prizes are often even handed out by real Nobel laureates. So, sure, the Ig Nobels sound like a joke. But in reality, they celebrate imagination, curiosity, and the lighter side of science. On that note, got any wacky research idea that could make you eligible for the Igs? Who knows… the next one could have your name on it. Here’s a soundtrack to put you in the mood 🎵 Chaand Aawara by Swanand Kirkire, Shrey Gupta, and Khwaab You can thank our reader, Ritik Agarwal, for this soothing rec. What caught our eye this week 👀 Copy, Paste, Polo Polo is no ordinary sport. You need skill to swing a 4-foot mallet at 60 km/h, strategy to outsmart the other team, and athleticism as rider and horse sprint across a field nearly three times the size of a football pitch. Add 500-kg animals and a ball barely bigger than an orange, and precision becomes key. The rules are simple: score by driving the ball through the goalposts, switch ponies every few minutes, and don’t cross your opponent’s line of play. Simple, yet full of ritual and flair — it’s why many call it the ‘game of kings.’ But the kingmaker in polo isn’t the mallet or the man. It’s the horse. Players rotate between 8–12 ponies per match, swapping after each “chukker”. A strong string of ponies means rhythm, stamina, and a bond with the rider. Nobody showed this better than Adolfo Cambiaso , the Argentine polo GOAT, whose mare Cuartetera was once hailed as the best of her generation. When Cuartetera died in 2023, Cambiaso didn’t just lose a pony. He lost his partner. And he wanted her back. So he turned to somatic cell nuclear transfer ( SCNT ) — better known as cloning or copy-paste cloning. The science is profound. You take a skin cell from the horse, extract the nucleus, (which contains its full genetic code) and place it into an egg cell from a donor mare that’s been emptied of its own DNA. Then zap it with a little electrical charge, and that egg is tricked into behaving like a fertilized embryo. And after 11 months, a foal is born—a near-identical twin of the original! Cambiaso produced six such clones and rode them to victory in Argentine Opens. “It was like cloning Messi”, he quipped. And one Cuartetera clone later sold for nearly $800,000. The sport was stunned. Argentina soon became a cloning hub, producing hundreds of foals annually. And so, regulators had to act. And here’s where it gets interesting, thanks to the distinction between SCNT and CRISPR. SCNT is essentially copy-paste. You’re replicating what already exists. And in 2012, the international equestrian federation had already allowed cloned horses in competition, arguing that “a clone is just another way of reproducing the same genetics”. So many polo boards followed suit, and copying was allowed, yet it stayed a controversial topic. But CRISPR is different. It's a find-replace. Instead of replicating nature, you rewrite it. It’s like swapping out words in a sentence. In 2024, Argentine biotech Kheiron unveiled the first CRISPR-edited polo foals. By knocking down the myostatin gene (which limits muscle growth) they were engineered to be faster and stronger. And this, the Argentine Polo Association believed, was a step too far. So it banned them immediately. Their statement was blunt saying that copying is natural reproduction, but editing is manipulation. So today, clones are allowed in most matches. Gene-edited ponies are not. Still, cloning is a booming business, with labs charging $85,000+ per foal and demand rising. But step back from polo, and you see a bigger story. If humans get this, what then? Historian Yuval Noah Harari has warned that once you can hack humans, you create a system with unprecedented inequality . CRISPR co-inventor Jennifer Doudna recalled a nightmare where Hitler had called and wanted to understand CRISPR. Others are more hopeful, arguing these tools could cure diseases and save endangered species. In sport, the tension is clear: are we cheering for raw talent…or technology? And honestly, no one knows where it stops. History shows humans always push the limits — with machines, medicines, or even genes. Polo just happens to be the testing ground, but maybe the real chukker is waiting elsewhere. So here’s the question: how much scientific “find-and-replace” are we willing to cheer for before sport itself starts to feel artificial? Because soon, it won’t just be about ponies. At some point, we’ll have to ask ourselves: are we applauding nature…or the lab that made it run faster?

Only few seats left — and this is your last chance to get clarity before the change. With that out of the way, let’s recap what we wrote this week. Are buybacks these days just kicking the can down the road? Buybacks are supposed to signal confidence. A company spends thousands of crores to mop up its own shares, and investors feel reassured as earnings per share tick up, the stock price finds a floor, and everyone applauds. But what happens when this quick fix comes at the cost of tomorrow’s battles? For instance, Infosys recently rolled out an ₹18,000 crore buyback, even as it stares at the twin challenges of AI disruption and looming tariff risks in the US. So the question is: should companies be splurging on stock optics, or saving for invention and insurance? That’s something we try to answer in our Monday’s newsletter . Why India needs a coin replacement policy UPI may dominate our payments, but one tiny denomination refuses to fade away. The ₹1 coin. The irony, though, is that it costs more than a rupee to mint every single one. That means the government loses money on every coin it produces, and yet nearly 40% of all coins in circulation today are ₹1. So why does the government tolerate this loss? Because for millions of Indians, from street vendors to daily wage earners, the coin still makes everyday life possible. And scrapping it would create chaos. Does that mean India is stuck footing the bill forever, or could smarter policies cut costs without hurting trust? Our Tuesday’s story explores how countries like Canada and Malaysia dealt with their smallest coins, and what India could learn from them. Why is Amazon late to the quick commerce party? Zomato’s Blinkit and Swiggy’s Instamart have been duking it out for years, burning cash to grab market share. Dunzo and JioMart Express already collapsed under the pressure. And just when the dust seems to be settling, Amazon has walked into the ring with its own 10-minute delivery play. On the surface, the timing looks odd. But dig deeper and it starts to make sense. Post-pandemic losses, regulatory hurdles on foreign e-commerce, and an early chance to learn from others’ mistakes may explain Amazon’s strategy. And now, with its massive user base and deep pockets, the company believes it can still tilt the game. But can a late-mover really win in a space where rivals are bleeding money? Check out the Wednesday’s newsletter to find out more. Why Bengaluru has the most expensive metro This February, lakhs of Bengaluru commuters swiped their metro cards and got a shock. Fares had jumped by almost 70%, making Namma Metro the priciest in India. BMRCL said costs had soared, but a closer look showed the numbers didn’t add up neatly. Because on a per-kilometre basis, expenses had risen far less than the authority claimed, and ridership had actually surged. So why the steep hike? Well, the truth lies in Bengaluru’s metro finances that are filled with massive debts, delays that balloon project costs, and a funding structure heavily dependent on a cash-strapped state government. We tell you about these in detail, and if fare hikes can really make it sustainable in our Thursday story here . FMCG giants want some chips at Balaji Wafers From a Rajkot cinema canteen in the 1970s to a ₹40,000 crore valuation today, Balaji Wafers has quietly built an empire. And with 65% market share in states like Gujarat and Maharashtra, a sacred commitment to ₹5/₹10 price points, and a distribution muscle that reaches 4.5 lakh kiranas, it’s little wonder that FMCG giants and private equity firms want a stake. But scaling a regional champion into a national brand isn’t easy. It risks eroding the very authenticity that built Balaji’s moat.

Half of India’s installed power capacity now comes from non-fossil fuels, and solar alone accounts for nearly 49% of renewables. So clearly, India wants to pivot away from coal, and a few solar companies are helping drive that shift. But what really makes this clean energy pivot possible? Well, the panels themselves! You’ve probably seen them everywhere from residential houses to industrial parks and massive solar farms. These shiny modules are the building blocks of India’s solar push, and only a handful of companies manufacture them at scale. Because making them isn’t easy. For long, India depended on imports for 80–85% of its module needs. Domestic capacity has only recently caught up, thanks to policy pushes and demand spikes. And this is the space where Satvik Green Energy, a relatively young player, is trying to cement its place. Founded in 2017, it started as a small player with just 125 MW of capacity. But over the past eight years it has scaled up dramatically to 3.7 GW (gigawatt). And now, it wants to double that again. For investors, the pitch is simple: buy into India’s solar future through one of its fastest-growing module makers. So let’s understand its business. Saatvik makes three types of solar panels: the older MonoPERC modules, the newer N-TopCon modules, and some smaller sales of polycrystalline modules. MonoPERC panels, short for monocrystalline passive emitter and rear cell, are like the “second-generation” panels that replaced the old clunky ones a few years ago. They’re designed to handle heat better and still keep working even on cloudy days. For a while, these were the company’s bread and butter. Then came the upgrade — N-TopCon or Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact panels. The idea here is simple. Engineers added a thin extra layer, called a tunnel oxide, on top of the regular design. This tiny tweak helps the panel trap more sunlight and convert it into electricity more efficiently. That’s why these panels are now Saatvik’s biggest money-spinner. And finally, there are the polycrystalline panels, the older, cheaper cousins that still sell a bit but don’t dominate the charts anymore. For a while, MonoPERC panels were the workhorse for Saatvik. In FY24, they brought in nearly ₹943 crores, but by FY25, their share slipped to ₹835 crores. And that wasn’t because demand collapsed but because Saatvik introduced N-TopCon panels, and customers quickly started switching. In FY24, these panels already contributed over ₹150 crores. But sales exploded to ₹1,224 crores in FY25, overtaking MonoPERC to become Saatvik’s biggest business line. In short, what started as a small slice of revenue turned into the company’s main engine in a year. Source: Company RHP The older polycrystalline panels chipped in ₹101 crores in FY25, but they’re more of a legacy product now. That shift in product mix is exactly what powered Saatvik’s rapid growth. From ₹531 crores in FY23, revenue doubled to ₹1,097 crores in FY24 and doubled again to ₹2,192 crores in FY25. And profits followed too, jumping from ₹100 crores in FY24 to nearly ₹214 crores in FY25. The only catch? It’s that profits are slim compared to sales because making panels is capital-hungry. In FY25, expenses swallowed ₹1,912 crores of revenue, with raw materials and services alone costing ₹1,136 crores. And since 42% of those inputs (like solar cells and aluminium frames) are imported from China, costs can swing around with global price changes. So Saatvik wants to bet on scale to take its growth story up another notch. Out of the ₹900 crores it’s raising through the IPO, nearly half — ₹477 crores — will go into building a massive 4 GW solar plant in Odisha. That will more than double its current manufacturing capacity from 3,742 MW (megawatt) to over 7,700 MW. And that’s quite a leap. Of course, it still trails the giants. Waaree sits at 13,300 MW and Premier Energies at 5,100 MW. But the Odisha project could help Saatvik close that gap faster. Another ₹166 crores from the IPO will be used to repay debt of its subsidiary Saatvik Solar Industries, which is executing the Odisha project. This will bring down its leverage from a debt-to-equity ratio that’s already improved sharply from 7.1x in FY23 to 1.3x now. The rest is earmarked for small borrowings and general corporate needs. Now, the Odisha project itself is a smart bet. It’s located in Tata Steel’s SEZ at Gopalpur, giving Saatvik easy port access for faster imports, plus a basket of incentives — no electricity duty, full stamp duty reimbursement, a ₹2/unit tariff subsidy for ten years, and even a 30% capital subsidy. Put together, these perks make the expansion far cheaper to execute for Saatvik. But of course there are risks. Saatvik’s RHP makes it clear that the company’s growth story isn’t without its vulnerabilities. A big one is customer concentration. In FY25, just 10 clients accounted for nearly 58% of revenue, and this reliance has been even higher in earlier years. So losing even one large buyer could leave a serious dent in sales. Another is raw material exposure. The company depends heavily on imported inputs like solar PV cells and aluminium frames, with over 40% sourced from abroad. So if global prices swing or supply chains tighten, costs could climb and margins get squeezed. And let’s talk about valuations. At the upper price band of ₹465 per share, Saatvik will be valued at around ₹6,000 crores. That’s still tiny compared to its listed rivals — Waaree at nearly ₹1 lakh crores and Premier Energies at about ₹47,000 crores. But to be fair, those players operate at a much bigger scale, with higher installed capacity and wider presence. Saatvik has been catching up fast though. And one of the most interesting figures is of its order book that’s jumped nearly tenfold in just a year — from ₹559 crores to over ₹5,000 crores — a sign that demand for its modules is very real. The financial picture has also sharpened. Operating profit margins have risen from a thin 3.9% in FY23 to 16.4% in FY25, while net profit margins are holding around 9%. That’s lower than peers like Waaree and Premier, which run at 14% levels, but it shows steady improvement. Return on equity, a measure of how much profit the company makes on shareholder money, is a staggering 63% in FY25. So yeah, Saatvik is at an inflection point. In just a few years, it has gone from a small player to a serious contender with a multithousand-crore order book and technology that’s in step with global trends. And the IPO gives it the firepower to double capacity and clean up its balance sheet, putting it in a stronger position to chase India’s solar boom. But the story, as we saw, isn’t without wrinkles, and a lot depends on whether the new Odisha plant helps these numbers scale further without eroding profitability. So while this isn’t a finished product like the existing listed players, it’s more of a growth bet — one that could shine brighter if the execution matches the ambition, or dim quickly if costs and competition catch up. And the coming years will decide how brightly this bet on solar shines.

https://finshots.in/archive/fmcg-giants-want-some-chips-at-balaji-wafers,2025-09-19,Business,FMCG giants want some chips at Balaji Wafers,"19 September 2025 • Business FMCG giants want some chips at Balaji Wafers In today’s Finshots, we tell you why private equity and FMCG giants are queuing up for a stake in Balaji Wafers. But here’s a quick sidenote before we begin. In just a few days, GST on insurance premiums will be gone — making policies cheaper. And while most people will scramble to make sense of it, you can walk in prepared. Join our 2-day masterclass where we break down health and life insurance in simple, actionable steps. You’ll know exactly what to buy, how much cover you should choose, and what traps to avoid. 👉🏽 Click here to reserve your spot today . Only few seats left — and this is your last chance to get clarity before the change. Now, onto today’s story. The Story Balaji Wafers is an oddity. Its story begins in 1974 with a cinema canteen counter in Rajkot, where Chandubhai Virani noticed that fried chips were selling faster than sandwiches that went soggy. And moviegoers weren’t satisfied with the canteen wafers either. That’s when he started frying his own chips “Balaji Wafers”, which brought in long queues. And the rest is history. What began as a backyard hustle became an automated factory in 1995, and today it clocks nearly ₹5,550 crore in FY24 sales and ₹578 crore in profits, almost neck-and-neck with Jubilant FoodWorks, a listed food giant worth over ₹43,000 crores. Which is why private equity firms and FMCG biggies like Temasek, ITC, General Mills and PepsiCo are circling a 10% stake deal that pegs Balaji at ₹40,000 crores. But how exactly did a regional player from Gujarat reach the same table as global titans? Well, the answer lies in how it cracked each step of the wafer journey, right from the farm to the kirana shelf. You see, snacking is a tricky business. Especially chips, which make up a nice chunk of Balaji’s products. You’re dealing with perishables and their prices fluctuate a lot. Then you need to crack pricing that’s competitive. The quality matters too – which potatoes you use, how they’re cut and processed and how they’re packed. And even when you get these things right, distribution remains a tough nut, with many regional as well as giants entrenched in the market. So, the profitability quite depends on: keeping the ₹5/₹10 price points sacred varying grammage to ride inflation, and moving tonnage through kiranas faster than competitors can refill their shelves But Balaji cracked it all. Some by doing different things, some by doing things differently. So let’s start with raw materials and wafer physics. The starting point to make chips is messy. Potatoes aren’t interchangeable. For wafers, you need low-moisture, high-solid varieties that don’t wilt in storage or turn brown in the fryer. That’s why PepsiCo spent years engineering its FC5 variety in India — a low-moisture variety bred specifically for chips, and contracted thousands of farmers under strict buy-back agreements. Balaji had no such R&D muscle. Instead, it went the local way. It leaned on Gujarat’s potato belt and gradually built ties with farmers — from about 400–600 contract growers a decade ago to a broader network of 2,000 suppliers today, 80% of them farmers. To back that up, it invested in a 10,000-tonne cold storage facility so it could buy in bulk at harvest and stretch supply through the year. And the result was a procurement model that made its supply behave more like a factory line than a crop cycle. Which meant stable quality, lower wastage, and resilience when potato prices swung wildly season to season. But farming’s just the start. Once the spuds are peeled, sliced, fried and seasoned, you still need to squeeze every rupee out of the supply chain. Oil alone makes up 25–30% of raw material costs, and when edible oil prices shot up in 2019, the shock hit most players. Balaji’s answer wasn’t to touch the sacrosanct ₹5 and ₹10 MRPs. Instead, it played the fine game of grammage and scale. For perspective, a ₹10 pack of Balaji’s salted chips has at times carried 35 grams versus Lay’s 23 grams — a “more chips, less air” contrast that Balaji even ran ads on . So to the consumer, the value equation never broke. Trust was preserved, and that perception of “more for your rupee” became Balaji’s moat. While rivals splurged on advertising, Balaji simply taught people to trust the weight in their palm. But this perception also needed a distribution muscle. So Balaji followed a D-Mart style playbook: saturate one geography before expanding next door. Gujarat first, then Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Madhya Pradesh. Adjacency meant shorter truck routes, localised flavours, and faster word of mouth. And behind this was a dense network: over 1,200 distributors and 1,300 dealers, supplying to 4.5 lakh kiranas. It even reportedly dabbled in guerrilla marketing — from plastering kirana walls with Balaji logos to allegedly employing people to walk into stores and ask for its wafers by name. And while rivals like ITC and PepsiCo routinely spend 8–12% of sales on advertising, Balaji kept spends at just 2% to 4% . It let distribution, visibility, and word-of-mouth do the heavy lifting. The result was dominance. Today, it has close to 65% market share in chips, namkeen and bhujia in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan. Nationally, it has leapfrogged brands like Bingo and Uncle Chipps to become the third-largest namkeen (salty snack) brand, behind only PepsiCo and Haldiram’s, with about a 12% share of India’s ₹43,800-crore market. Of course, it wasn’t all smooth frying. PepsiCo dragged Balaji to court in 2013, alleging its packs looked too much like Lay’s. And in 2018, the Bombay High Court restrained Balaji from selling its “Rumbles” ridged chips, ruling they resembled Lay’s Maxx design. For most regional players, that would’ve been fatal. Packaging is a battlefield in FMCG, where shoppers decide in seconds and changes in color and fonts can make a huge difference. But Balaji bet that consumers weren’t loyal to design quirks, they were loyal to the “Balaji” name. And so it overhauled packaging, doubled down on distribution, kept the price-value promise intact… and it came out stronger. Sales climbed, while Lay’s actually ceded share in Gujarat and Maharashtra. Oh and PepsiCo wasn’t just fighting Balaji. In 2019, it sued Gujarat farmers , demanding ₹1 crore each for cultivating its FC5 potatoes without licence — a battle it later withdrew after public backlash. Balaji, which sourced openly from local farmers, looked like the underdog champion of the agrarian side. And by the 2020s, its plants were processing about 1 lakh kg of potato wafers and 5 lakh kg of namkeen every single day , a capacity that silently compounded. And as it scaled, it never lost its flair for localisation. A masala mix that works in Surat might not click in Kota, so recipes were tweaked region by region. The entry ladder of ₹5 and ₹10 stayed sacred, but family packs offered a way to trade up. And that’s how, over time, Balaji built 65+ products across wafers, namkeen, extruded snacks, and noodles. But here’s the real question. Can authenticity survive scale? Turning a regional wafer king into a national FMCG play requires moves that risk eroding the very magic that built it. You need to standardise SKUs to unlock logistics, which flattens local taste. You need to ramp up advertising to win modern trade and quick-commerce shelves, which bloats costs. And you need premium variants to please investors, which risks alienating the ₹5/₹10 loyalists. There’s also competition from local players. And if investors are onboard, the brand will have to scale. Maybe even think about an IPO so they get an exit. The salty snacks market, after all, is booming and growing in double digits. Rivals are formidable from Lay’s with global R&D, ITC with deep pockets, Haldiram’s with national scale, Prataap Snacks and countless local challengers. Balaji has held them off in its strongholds, but national expansion will demand moves that could dull its local edge. But as we’ve seen, this isn’t a company that's stopping. And it’s already testing its bite beyond wafers by giving established players a tough fight in the noodle aisle with its Gippi Masala Noodles. And perhaps that’s why everyone wants in. They probably know that Balaji offers a few things money can’t easily buy: credibility at the kirana counter where shelf space is earned, not bought; the sanctity of the ₹5/₹10 grammar without bleeding margins; and a flavour engine that knows how to tilt masala across regions. Plus, it’s also the last big regional gatekeeper left. Building another Balaji from scratch would take a decade — and far more capital than anyone admits. Which means the real bite is yet to come. India’s snack market is only going to get bigger (more than double to over ₹95,000 crores by 2032 as per estimates), and if Balaji can stretch its magic beyond the existing states and newer global geographies, it won’t just stay the last great regional player but could in fact be another true homegrown challenger to the multinationals.

Only 300 seats are open — and this is your last chance to get clarity before the change. Now, onto today’s story. The Story Amazon has announced its 10-minute delivery service, Amazon Now, in Mumbai. Now, this feels like a natural step after its launch in Bengaluru and Delhi a few months ago, where daily orders grew 25% month on month. And with 100-plus dark stores already in place and plans to add hundreds more by the end of the year, Amazon seems serious. But here’s the catch. 2025 feels a little too late for a quick commerce debut in India. This is already a cut-throat game where players bleed cash to keep customers hooked. To give you a sense, average discounts have doubled in two years, from under 10% of MRP to 20-25% today. And because of these heavy discounts, profit margins that are already razor-thin or even negative, are shrinking further. Numbers from the top two quick commerce players — both backed by listed parent companies, tell the story. Take Zomato’s Blinkit, the market leader with a 52% share . Its revenues jumped 155% year-on-year (and 40% quarter-on-quarter) in Q1FY26 to ₹2,400 crores. But despite this surge, profits didn’t follow. Its operating losses swelled to ₹162 crores from just ₹3 crores a year ago. And if you break that down as a percentage of Net Order Value (NOV), Blinkit’s operating margin stood at -1.8%. In case you’re wondering, NOV is basically the total value of all orders after deducting fees and discounts. Or look at Instamart, Swiggy’s arm with a 25% market share. Its revenues grew 113% YoY to ₹859 crores (and 17% QoQ). But operating losses ballooned to ₹896 crores, or nearly three times what it lost a year ago. And as a percentage of NOV, that’s a margin of -21%. Which makes you wonder… why has Amazon shown up this late to the quick commerce party, especially now, when players are burning cash to hold their ground? Let’s tackle the first question and talk about Amazon’s delay to begin with. Look, Amazon is a retail giant as you know it. In India alone, it pulls in over ₹25,500 crores a year. So running a quick commerce business, even with initial losses, isn’t really a big deal. Its deep pockets mean the American parent can absorb those losses until things turn profitable. But timing was everything here. When India’s quick commerce boomed, Amazon Inc. was wrestling with its own post-pandemic headaches. During Covid, profits doubled as people shopped online in droves. But Amazon simply couldn’t hire or build warehouses fast enough. And once the pandemic eased, shoppers flocked back to physical stores. Inflation didn’t help either as it made people more hesitant to spend. And if you dig into Amazon’s financials, one particular year — 2022 stands out . It was Amazon’s first unprofitable year since 2014. The culprit? A massive bet on electric vehicle maker Rivian. For context, Amazon took a 20% stake, seeing it as a way to electrify its delivery fleet and meet its climate pledge. It even committed to buying 1 lakh Rivian vans by 2030. But unfortunately for Amazon, that year Rivian stumbled. It priced cars poorly, missed growth targets, and its stock price crashed 82% in 2022, which also wiped billions off Amazon’s books. That forced Amazon to slam the brakes on some projects . It paused growth at Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh, closed a few stores, froze hiring, and doubled down on businesses that made money like AWS and digital services. And since Amazon’s India playbook is tied closely to decisions made in the US, quick commerce wasn’t exactly high on the agenda back then. The focus was survival and recovery. But fast forward to today, Amazon has bounced back to profitability globally and steadied its ship. Which is why it probably feels ready to enter India’s quick commerce race, even if the party started without it. Then there’s the matter of regulation. India has had strict FDI rules for e-commerce in place since 2016. So foreign-owned players like Amazon could not hold inventory or sell directly to customers. They had to stick to a “ pure marketplace ” model that simply connected buyers and sellers. That upended Amazon’s playbook. It had to rethink how it pushed private labels like Solimo and Amazon Basics. And in that environment, building a direct quick commerce business was pretty much off the table. Sure, 100% FDI was still allowed in marketplaces, but the rules barred them from owning goods, fixing prices, or even letting one seller account for more than 25% of total sales. The idea was to level the field for smaller Indian businesses. But Amazon and Walmart weren’t going to sit still. They worked around it through joint ventures with third-party sellers like Cloudtail (now closed) and Appario Retail ( acquired by Clicktech in 2024), which gave them indirect control. It was technically legal, but always under scrutiny. But now that those tie-ups have ended, Amazon has more room to set up dark stores for quick commerce, as long as it plays strictly by the marketplace rules. And finally, there’s the late-mover advantage. Yup, you read that right. You’d normally think that the first movers have the best shot at making it big and holding their ground in a crowded market. After all, that’s what the economics textbooks tell us. But an SPJIMR study points out that sometimes arriving late can actually be a blessing. And Amazon’s entry into quick commerce feels more like a calculated delay than a misstep. See, while rivals were busy locking themselves into models that worked for an early market, Amazon got to sit back and watch. It’s seen how wafer-thin margins or even consistent losses broke the backs of well-funded players like Dunzo and JioMart Express . It’s seen how customer expectations shifted and where competitors have struggled. And now, it can build for the market as it is today — not as it used to be. Plus, Amazon brings serious firepower. Its 200 million monthly active users dwarf Blinkit’s 13.7 million and Instamart’s 9.8 million. It can offer a seamless experience where shoppers flip between buying instant essentials and everything else they don’t need right away. And unlike rivals who are busy chasing city crowds, Amazon has an edge. Its reach goes well beyond metros. Think of smaller towns where older folks still run the household and may not always be able to step out for essentials, especially with their children working in bigger cities. It’s only a matter of time before they get comfortable with quick commerce apps. And if most of them can already use WhatsApp, Facebook or pay through UPI, a simple, easy-to-use quick commerce app by Amazon could make that leap even easier. Early signs look promising too. Amazon suggests that its Prime members have already tripled their shopping frequency after using Amazon Now. And if Amazon leans on quality and variety, not just speed, that could be its real edge. But whether that’s enough to take on Blinkit, Instamart or Flipkart Minutes — backed by American giant Walmart, is something we’ll just have to wait and see.

https://finshots.in/archive/why-india-needs-a-coin-replacement-policy-2,2025-09-16,Policy,Why India needs a coin replacement policy,"16 September 2025 • Policy Why India needs a coin replacement policy In today’s Finshots, we look at why India still mints the ₹1 coin at a loss, and how smarter minting could fix it. But before we begin, if you’re someone who loves to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance, then hit subscribe if you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story. The Story When UPI took over India’s payment culture, it didn’t just change how people paid. It also quietly pushed physical currency — especially coins, into the shadows. Think about it. In just eight years, UPI transactions shot up from 64 lakh in March 2017 to a jaw-dropping 1,830 crore by March 2025. And as phones began to buzz with payments, India’s currency mints began to fall silent. Just look at the numbers. Between 2017 and 2024*, coin production by the Securities Printing and Minting Corporation of India (SPMCIL), the sole operator of India’s currency printing and minting, fell by 88%, down to just 120 crore coins . Currency notes, on the other hand, barely moved up by only about 10% in the same span. For the government, this shift is actually a win because minting coins isn’t cheap. They’re made of metal, and when you look at cost as a percentage of their value (like the cost of producing a ₹5 coin versus its face value of ₹5), coins are far more expensive to produce than notes. But here’s where things get tricky. Despite the fall in coin use, one stubborn little denomination refuses to fade away. We’re talking about the humble ₹1 coin. Back in 2018, an RTI filed by India Today revealed the true cost of minting. The ₹1 coin cost ₹1.11 to produce. In other words, the government was losing money on every single one. And it wasn’t just the ₹1 coin skating on thin ice. The ₹2 coin cost ₹1.28 to make, and the ₹5 coin, ₹3.58. Even those were on wafer-thin margins. And remember, this was back in 2018. Seven years later, it’s safe to assume those costs are even higher today. Now, with UPI booming, you’d think the government would simply cut back. After all, SPMCIL’s minting capacity is running at just 15%. But here’s the surprise. The ₹1 coin still dominates circulation. Nearly 40% of all coins floating in the economy today are of this denomination. So despite the economics being far from sustainable, the ₹1 coin clings to life. And that leaves us with the obvious question — why does the government keep minting it? It’s simple really. The ₹1 coin may be a loss-making venture, but it’s still indispensable. Rural communities, the urban poor, street vendors, small businesses, even public transport — they all rely on it. Besides, many tiny transactions can’t be digitised or handled with bigger notes. And coins, after all, aren’t just money; they’re symbols of trust and certainty in a country where cash is still king. For someone unaccustomed to rounding off digital bills, a ₹1 coin makes all the difference. That’s why the government tolerates the loss. In minting terms, it’s called a “production loss” — small enough to be written off because the coin plays a vital role in keeping the system running smoothly. But here’s the thought. Does it have to stay this way? What if India could still find a way to reduce these losses? Because this isn’t just India’s problem. Almost every country has wrestled with the economics of its lowest-value coins. Take the US, for instance. It has been minting pennies for over 230 years, but each 1 cent coin costs nearly 4 cents to produce. That’s why they’ve been mulling a phase-out. Canada took the plunge in 2012. Australia ditched its pennies way back in 1992 . And when countries drop their smallest coins, they usually adopt “rounding rules”. Malaysia, for instance, rounded cash payments upwards or downwards to the nearest 5 sen (smallest unit of the ringgit). So, a bill of RM82.08 simply became RM82.10. Old coins remained legal tender, but no new ones were churned out. Now, sure, this may not be an apples-to-apples comparison, since the sen is more like the Indian equivalent of paise. But the difference is that sen is still used for paying bills in Malaysia, while paise is no longer in the picture here. India, however, doesn’t have such a coin replacement policy. The Coinage Act of 1906 , gave the Centre power to withdraw coins but never said when. The 2011 version doesn’t spell it out either. Compare that to the US: when silver became too pricey in the 1960s, its Coinage Act clearly set specifications to phase silver out. But replicating similar rounding rules or coin replacement policies in India would be far more complicated. In countries like Canada and Australia, rounding applies only to cash payments and barely matters because digital transactions dominate and purchases are usually of higher value. In contrast, India’s story is very different. A huge section of the population still depends on cash for everyday needs. Imagine the government suddenly saying it’ll stop producing small coins and instead round off bills. That would spark chaos. Because here, exact amounts matter. Street vendors, small shops, daily wage earners, and informal markets rely on every rupee. Rounding off could unfairly hit lower-income households that deal in small sums. And without widespread digital access or literacy, replacing exact change with rounded payments could fuel confusion, mistrust, and losses for those who can least afford it. So if scrapping coins and enforcing round-offs won’t work here, what’s the alternative, you ask? See, if India decides to keep minting the ₹1 coin — whether because it’s the lowest denomination or simply because people still need it — there’s one practical option: cut production costs and make minting cheaper. Right now, the ₹1 coin is made of ferritic stainless steel with iron and chromium, and each weighs 3.76 grams. To put that in perspective, it’s about 50% heavier than the US penny ( 2.5 grams ) and nearly 60% heavier than the euro one cent coin ( 2.3 grams ). Heavier coins, naturally, mean higher costs. Other countries have experimented with alternatives. The US, for instance, tweaked its penny in 1982, moving from a mostly copper coin to one that was copper-plated, with 95% zinc underneath . Over time, the copper content dropped further to just 2.5%. That kept production affordable for decades, though even now the US is wondering if 2025 should be the penny’s final year. Europe went another route. In 2017 , eurozone mints decided to standardise how they make the smallest coins. They agreed to use the same kind of metal, allow small variations in thickness and diameter, and make the designs on the coins a little less deep. These tweaks made the coins cheaper and easier to produce in bulk. What they didn’t change was the coin’s size, weight, or how it worked in vending machines. So the public barely noticed a thing, while the mints quietly saved money in the background. India could do something similar. By optimising materials and streamlining processes, the government could bring down minting costs without disrupting size, weight, or the trust people place in their coins. Because every time a coin looks or feels different, public suspicion runs high. This way, the humble ₹1 coin stays in circulation, the government doesn’t bleed money with each mint, and production gets standardised without tampering with what people already know and trust. Because even if it costs a little more to make, the ₹1 coin still holds ground nationwide and we’re not ready to part with it just yet. What do you think?

https://finshots.in/archive/are-buybacks-these-days-just-kicking-the-can-down-the-road,2025-09-15,Capital Markets,Are buybacks these days just kicking the can down the road?,"15 September 2025 • Capital Markets Are buybacks these days just kicking the can down the road? In today’s Finshots, we ask: are stock buybacks really value creation or just short term applause? But before we begin, if you love keeping up with the buzz in business and finance, make sure to subscribe and join the Finshots club, loved by over 5 lakh readers. Already a subscriber or reading this on the app? You’re all set. Let's get started with the story! The Story Would you rather have ₹1,000 today or double it and get it a year from now? When asked this question, people would generally give varied answers. They would consider factors like their immediate need for cash, their confidence in being disciplined enough to wait, how much they trust the promise of receiving the doubled amount, and even the impact of inflation or potential investment returns during that year. Buybacks are the stock market’s version of that question. A company announces that it’ll repurchase its own shares, usually at a premium. If you, as the shareholder, tender, you get cash now. If you don’t, your slice of the pie usually gets bigger. It feels neat and painless, a financial sleight of hand that pleases everyone in the short run. That’s why buybacks are so loved. And companies normally do them for two reasons: They think the market undervalues their stock, or They don’t see enough attractive projects to invest in. Either way, there will be fewer shares floating, higher earnings per share, and a firmer floor under the price. This neatness is exactly why buybacks can be seductive. Because when a business stands at a strategic crossroads, the easiest thing to do with cash is to hand it back. Which brings us to Infosys. The company board just rolled out a ₹18,000 crore buyback. Investors cheered, and the stock price ticked up last week. On paper, that’s a win. But how does this actually hold up in the long run? To answer this question, let’s go back to why companies announce buybacks: undervaluation or future investments. If this were about “undervaluation”, the numbers don’t scream emergency. Infosys has a price to earnings or P/E ratio of around 23x earnings, while the Nifty IT index sits near 26x. And this difference is not that bad. This leaves the other textbook explanation: not enough investment opportunities. But that’s the part that doesn’t add up either. Indian IT isn’t starved of places to deploy capital. It’s staring at two looming battles where having cash in hand is vital: AI and tariffs. Spending thousands of crores to keep the stock from sliding may be comforting, but it’s not what will win those battles. Let’s start with AI. Generative AI is already chewing into the bottom half of the services pyramid, ticket resolution, regression testing, documentation, boilerplate code, and L1/L2 support. Even the high-end architecture, domain consulting, and product design are being reshaped by copilots and domain-tuned models. The companies that will defend pricing power aren’t the ones distributing cash; they’re the ones turning services into software, packaging know-how into tools, building reusable IP, and fusing data, model ops, and change management into something clients can’t easily shop around. Then, there’s the research & development (R&D). Indian IT has historically under-indexed on genuine R&D compared to our global peers. And that under-investment was manageable when the moat was labour arbitrage and process discipline. However, it gets fragile when the moat is algorithms and proprietary platforms. Even a fraction of this buyback, if invested into product development, vertical LLMs, automation suites, and AI research, could compound into defensible margins. The alternative is to become the implementation layer for someone else’s IP; busy, billable, and permanently replaceable. Add to this the tariff time bomb. The US remains the primary profit pool for Indian IT, and it’s also the most politically volatile market for trade. What insulates a services company here is liquidity. A fat balance sheet that can absorb a few soft quarters without cutting muscle. When you spend ₹18,000 crore on buybacks, you lower the shock absorbers. It’s as if the weather forecast says “stormy” and you splurge on sunglasses. In fact, we wrote about this earlier here . Now you might say, “Hey, Finshots. But buybacks are not evil. After all, they give an exit to the retail investors at a premium.” And you’d be right. They’re flexible (unlike dividends, they don’t lock you into a recurring obligation), they boost per-share earnings, and they also signal confidence that the business will grow. But the problem isn’t that buybacks exist; it’s that their timing, size, and context matter more now than they did 10 years ago. Look at the context here. Infosys’ stock has lagged for three years. A buyback can help put a floor under that trend. But price floors don’t repair business models. The two threats, AI and tariffs, don’t yield to earnings per share (EPS) optics. They yield to invention and insurance. Invention is R&D: the patience to build IP that’s hard to dislodge, even if it depresses margins for a couple of years. Insurance is like a rainy-day fund: it reflects the understanding that unexpected global events can disrupt even the best-laid plans, and having extra cash in reserve helps ensure stability without forcing difficult trade-offs in such moments. Now, mind you, we’re not just talking about Infosys here. The firms that treat today’s surplus as venture capital, rather than distribute it for today’s applause, will own tomorrow’s industry. However, for investors, buybacks can feel reassuring in the short run. They lift EPS, cushion stock declines, and sometimes even act as a backstop in rough markets. But for a company, that comfort lasts only a short time. Because while buybacks stabilize the stock, they don’t strengthen it. And that’s where the real choice lies. One path is instant gratification; the other is compounded resilience. In a year when algorithms are learning to write the code people pay you for, and politicians are reshaping the stable environment, it should be obvious which path is more valuable. So here’s a different formulation of the opening question. Would you rather have a few extra rupees per share today, or a business that can still defend its price per share ten years from now? Buybacks will always have their place. But for Infosys, and much of the Indian IT industry, the smarter money is invention and insurance .

https://finshots.in/archive/social-media-trading-a-gi-for-kulcha-and-more,2025-09-14,Sunny Side Up,"Social media trading?, a GI for kulcha and more...","14 September 2025 • Sunny Side Up Social media trading?, a GI for kulcha and more... Hey folks! If you’ve ever been to Punjab or Delhi, chances are you’ve tasted one of the most addictive street foods around — the humble kulcha. Golden, flaky and best enjoyed with chole (chickpea curry), a dollop of butter, some curd and tangy achar (pickle) on the side, it’s the kind of dish that keeps you going back for more. Now, there are plenty of stories about how this delicacy came to be. One version takes us back to Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s court in pre-partition Punjab. His cook, Ram Das , is said to have experimented with dough kneaded using fermented chickpea water, fennel and a dash of a secret masala. The king loved it so much that kulchas soon became a royal breakfast staple. But some other stories claim that kulchas are simply a desi cousin of the naan, adapted and perfected in Punjab. Some even say colonial kitchens borrowed French layering techniques, giving kulchas their signature flakiness. Whatever the truth, it’s clear that the dish has deep Punjabi roots. And now, Punjab is looking to give it a modern stamp of identity — a GI tag . If you’re wondering, that’s a “ Geographical Indication ” certification, the same kind that protects Darjeeling Tea or Kashmiri saffron. It basically ensures that when you say “Amritsari kulcha”, it really is from Amritsar, and not some generic imitation. Which makes you ask, why get a GI tag for something as simple as a kulcha? Well, you see, the kulcha isn’t just Amritsar’s pride. It’s woven into the food culture of Bihar, Lucknow, Delhi, Jammu, Kashmir and even Lahore. Everyone has their own version, and it’s close to people’s hearts wherever you go. But that’s where the confusion begins, and Punjab wants to avoid that because kulchas aren’t just food in Amritsar — they’re a livelihood. A single kulcha shop can rake in tens of thousands of rupees a day, selling plates for ₹30–70. It’s a business that sustains street vendors, bakers, flour suppliers and even rickshaw drivers ferrying hungry tourists straight to the stalls. And those tourists don’t just come from across India. Many travel from abroad just to savour an authentic kulcha. A GI tag could protect these small businesses from cheap imitations and open new doors. Think premium branding, exports to specialty markets or maybe even more franchised kulcha chains or packaged kulchas on supermarket shelves. With exports already hit hard — reportedly down 40% last year thanks to global trade disruptions, the timing couldn’t be better. So, the next time you’re digging into a buttery, crispy kulcha in Amritsar, remember — it might soon carry an official GI stamp of pride. But no matter the label, its humility and charm will always lie in that soft, comforting bite. Here’s a soundtrack to put you in the mood 🎵 Sadiyantra by Gauley Bhai Ready to roll? What caught our eye this week 👀 Social media + trading = 👍? Imagine you open your trading app and instead of boring candlesticks and overwhelming tickers, you’re scrolling through something that looks suspiciously like Instagram. A glossy feed full of likes and comments… except there are no sunsets or avocado toasts here. It’s your friend flexing his Tesla shares. Or a hedge fund manager sliding in with a big Apple buy. Or maybe even a politician adding Nvidia to their portfolio. Well, that’s Robinhood’s newest experiment. The US brokerage is rolling out something called “ Robinhood Social .” Think X or Reddit, but every post is backed by a real trade. The pitch is simple too. Small investors often feel shut out of the information loops that swirl around Wall Street insiders. This, Robinhood says, beams the action right into your feed. And it’s not just stocks. Robinhood’s weaving in prediction markets too . So, you could scroll past bets on elections, football finals, or even reality TV finales. It’s more like finance, speculation, and memes all served in one app. Sounds exciting? Absolutely. But here’s the thing. When trades double as content, investing can risk turning into performance art. A flashy screenshot can set off a meme rally. And those who hyped it up can cash out just as quietly, without posting their exits. Robinhood knows this too—it slaps a neat little disclaimer on the feed. Source Which, loosely translated, means: you’re on your own, buddy! And if history is any guide, that’s not reassuring. Remember India’s fantasy trading apps that blurred into gambling before regulators pulled the plug? Or the GameStop saga where viral posts sent prices to the moon before retail investors crashed back to earth? It all tells us that when finance turns into entertainment, the comedown is usually fast and costly. All of this just proves how thin the line between money and memes has become. Memes aren’t just the commentary anymore, they’re often the message . Retail investors may find this empowering. But it can just as easily tip into a slippery slope where one wild speculation fuels the next—something that regulators are bound to find terrifying. And Robinhood? Well, for them it’s a full circle moment. The company began in 2013 looking more like a social app than a broker. And a decade, a meme-stock saga, and a few bruises later, it’s once again betting that markets and memes belong together. So what do you think? Is Robinhood reinventing the markets or just giving them a like button? And should India get something similar too?

https://finshots.in/markets/whats-driving-the-prime-focus-re-run,2025-09-12,Markets,What’s driving the Prime Focus re-run?,"12 September 2025 • Markets What’s driving the Prime Focus re-run? In today’s Finshots, we tell you about an Indian media company that’s been rising this week. But before we begin, if you love keeping up with the buzz in business and finance, make sure to subscribe and join the Finshots club, loved by over 5 lakh readers. Already a subscriber or reading this on the app? You’re all set. Let's get started with the story! The Story Think about watching Dune . Or Inception . Or Interstellar . The kind of films that awe and swallow you whole with their visuals. Giant sandworms, collapsing dreamscapes, black holes you can almost feel tugging at you. But what’s less obvious is that behind all of that spectacle sits an Indian company – Prime Focus. Through its UK-based arm Double Negative ( DNEG ), it has been quietly shaping the biggest blockbusters in the world for over a decade. It’s one of the few Indian names that show up in Oscar credits, but back home, it was mostly known for being a smallcap stock that saw sharp swings. But over the past few weeks, the stock has been hitting upper circuits and drawn big investors. And to understand why, you first need to understand what Prime Focus actually is. Founded in a Mumbai garage in 1997 by Namit Malhotra, the grandson of Bollywood producer M.N. Malhotra, Prime Focus began as a modest post-production outfit. Post-production is everything that happens after the camera stops rolling: editing, colour grading, sound mixing, and increasingly, visual effects (VFX). By 2006, the company had listed on the stock exchange and even pioneered digital intermediate (DI) technology in India, a system that digitised film reels, so colour correction, grading and visual tweaks could be done digitally. Around the same time, VFX was booming worldwide, and Prime Focus stepped into that space too — but mainly through Bollywood movies and ad work. So it had built a strong domestic reputation, with early forays into stereo conversion for global films too. Yet it still lacked the scale to compete in Hollywood. The most transformative move came in 2014, when it acquired a majority stake in DNEG — the VFX studio already famous for working on Christopher Nolan films. That one deal turned Prime Focus from a local vendor into a global heavyweight. Today, DNEG contributes nearly 80% of consolidated revenue, employs over 10,000 people across countries, and competes with the likes of Weta FX and Framestore. And yeah, in July 2025, Prime Focus approved a preferential allotment that, once completed, is expected to raise its stake in DNEG to about 88%. Alongside DNEG sits ReDefine, which handles mid-budget shows and streaming work, and Prime Focus Technologies, which handles localisation, subtitling and digital delivery for OTT giants. This arm may only contribute around 10–12% of revenue, but it makes the group stickier in client relationships as it embeds them beyond the creative stage. And more recently, Prime Focus has seeded its own studio arm in India, with Ramayana — starring Ranbir Kapoor, who personally invested ₹15 crores into the company — as its marquee project. So on the surface, this business looks like a dream portfolio. Oscars, global blockbusters, Netflix and Amazon contracts, and now a big Indian IP. But look deeper and the economics tell a more sobering tale. You see, Prime Focus is a services company with staggering fixed costs . You need the top talent in the VFX industry, which also means fat salaries. And staff expenses alone in FY24 were ₹2,885 crores, or over 70% of revenue. Add another ₹558 crores in finance costs, and you have a structure that thrives when the order book is full, but collapses when projects dry up. And dry they did. Between FY19 and FY23 , when revenue grew from about ₹2,500 crores to ₹4,600 crores, EBITDA margins were healthy at 14–24%. But in FY24, when revenue slipped to ₹3,950 crores, those margins collapsed to barely 6%, and the company posted a net loss of ₹488 crores. The culprit? Well, it wasn’t poor capability but the Hollywood writers’ and actors’ strikes in 2023–24, which froze productions worldwide. So with no new shoots, there was no post-production, and Prime Focus had thousands of artists sitting on benches, costly software licences running, and global facilities to maintain. In short, it had to carry a vast cost base with little to bill. Now most companies in that situation would have downsized. But the twist in the story is that Prime Focus didn’t. Instead, the management doubled down the bets. In July 2024, its subsidiary DNEG acquired Prime Focus Technologies (PFT) for ₹693 crores . Now, PFT wasn’t into VFX, but it specialised in backend work and had built a generative AI platform for the media industry. So on paper the deal looked like an intra-group shuffle, but strategically it mattered. Because studios increasingly want fewer vendors who can handle both the creative and the backend. And by merging the two, DNEG could pitch itself as a one-stop partner, from crafting visuals to mastering and delivering content for streaming. At the same time, Prime Focus invested in AI-driven tools like Brahma to compress turnaround times and costs. And rather than wait only on Hollywood, it doubled down on India. Prime Focus Studios tied itself to Ramayana , pitched as India’s most ambitious visual epic. With DNEG and ReDefine handling the visuals, and Kapoor starring in it, the project became both pipeline and publicity. And then came the payoff. In Q1 FY26, as the Hollywood pipeline reopened in 2025 and Indian projects gained traction, revenue from operations jumped 23% year-on-year to ₹976 crores, total income touched ₹1,023 crores, and net profit swung to ₹110 crores versus a ₹158 crore loss in the same quarter a year earlier. EBITDA margins rebounded into the teens. The same benches that dragged margins down in FY24 now amplified them as utilisation returned. And that was the moment markets were waiting for. Proof that FY24 was not a death spiral, but a temporary strike-induced slump. And right on cue, respected investors in India stepped in. In early September 2025, block deals showed Madhu and Yash Kela’s Singularity AMC buying about 48 lakh shares (about 2% of the company), Ramesh Damani adding 8 lakh shares, and Utpal Sheth taking 17.5 lakh. Together they invested nearly ₹146 crores. And this was a powerful signal. Since these are investors who know that in fixed-cost businesses, profits can swing hardest right after the worst losses. They’ve seen it in metals, in cement, in airlines… and now in VFX. They also recognise the operating leverage at play in a business that looks glamorous on the surface but is governed by the same hard rules of capacity and demand. So, why would they be interested now, you ask? First, because Prime Focus sits on a global franchise that few Indian companies can match. DNEG is one of only a handful of studios trusted with nine-figure-budget films, and credibility at that level is an enormous moat. Second, because the numbers showed operating leverage in action. Losses ballooned when revenue fell, but profits surged just as dramatically when revenue recovered. If the Hollywood pipeline stays open, Prime Focus could deliver sequential quarters of profit growth without massive new investments. Third, because management used the downturn to strengthen the model like integrating technology, betting on India, and pushing AI. And lastly, because industry tailwinds are strong. The Indian VFX and animation industry, already a ₹10,300 crore segment in 2024, is growing and expected to touch ₹14,700 crores by 2027. Global studios are outsourcing more to India, where an entry-level artist costs less than counterparts. And Prime Focus seems to be well positioned for this boom. Of course, part of the run-up could also be about things markets can’t yet see. Big investors and ones involved with production might have a closer line to what’s brewing. Maybe DNEG is quietly securing bigger franchises, maybe AI-driven production tools will cut costs faster than expected, or say there are more mega-budget launches. But again, that’s all a guesswork. So the question now is what happens next? Well, again that’s anyone’s guess. But what we know is this is still a services business tied to production cycles. And another strike or any slowdown could sink utilisation. Plus, you need to look at the numbers. The company still has heavy debt, with annual finance costs of over ₹550 crores. Profits need to convert into cash flows that can service and reduce leverage, not just paper earnings. Working capital is chunky, with large receivables and milestone-based collections that delay cash conversion. The business is still highly reliant on international markets — Hollywood and streaming account for the bulk of revenue — so any disruption or studio budget cut could hurt. And the current narrative also largely leans on one project, Ramayana . If timelines slip or box office expectations disappoint, sentiment could flip just as quickly. But it’s also true that Prime Focus has pulled off something rare. It survived a once-in-a-generation content freeze, absorbed the pain of collapsing margins, preserved its global scale, stitched in new capabilities, and re-emerged with investors and a mega Indian project. In doing so, it reminded the market of why it mattered in the first place… because it’s one of the few Indian companies that can turn scripts into spectacles the whole world watches. So maybe the bigger question isn’t just how high the stock can run, but whether Ramayana and the next slate of films can carry the same weight as Dune . If it pulls that off, the credits might finally roll in Prime Focus’ favour. If not, it could just be another rerun of the ups and downs investors have seen before.

With that out of the way, let’s recap what we wrote this week. The world’s running out of natural rubber. How can India solve this? Every time you zip down the road on a scooter or see a surgeon wear gloves, there’s one silent hero holding it all together — natural rubber. But here’s the thing. The world is running short of it. Southeast Asia, which supplies three-fourths of global demand, is battling crop diseases and climate shocks. Prices are rising, risks are piling up, and India, which imports nearly 40% of its needs, is right in the middle of this squeeze. Could this crisis actually turn into an opportunity for India? Read Monday’s newsletter to find out. The Urban Company IPO explained Moving into a new home usually means battling dust and cobwebs before you can even unpack. But for me, a quick tap on the Urban Company (UC) app sorted it all. That’s the beauty of UC. It’s a one-stop shop for everything from cleaning and pest control to grooming and appliance repair. And now, the company behind this convenience is hitting the stock market with a ₹1,900 crore IPO. But is UC really as strong as it looks, or are there cracks beneath the polish? We broke it down for you in Tuesday’s newsletter . Could tempered glass be India’s next billion-dollar market? A teardrop of glass that could take hammer blows at one end, but shatter with a flick of its tail — that’s where the tempered glass story began in the 1600s. Centuries later, it became the invisible armour on your phone screen. But here’s the catch. In India, this ₹20,000 crore market is still dominated by imports and grey kiosks, while global players have turned it into a premium, branded business. And now, with new standards and even a Corning-backed factory in Noida, things are shifting. Does that mean India could finally crack the tempered glass game? We explored this in Wednesday’s newsletter . Why foreign banks are selling their retail business in India On paper, India looks like a banker’s paradise — a young population eager to swipe cards, take loans, and invest. Yet, one by one, the world’s biggest foreign banks are quietly packing up. Citi sold its retail arm to Axis Bank, Standard Chartered trimmed its loan book, and Deutsche Bank is now inviting bids. Meanwhile, Indian banks like SBI and HDFC are raking in record profits. Clearly, retail banking works here. So why couldn’t foreign giants crack the code? Click here to unpack the answers in Thursday’s newsletter. India’s Commonwealth Games gamble India has just officially submitted its bid to host the 2030 Commonwealth Games (CwG). And the only other contender is Nigeria. On the surface, that sounds exciting. But here’s the catch. Hosting these mega sporting events is almost always a money-losing deal. Budgets balloon, taxpayers foot the bill and the promised economic windfalls rarely materialise. In fact, recent hosts like Australia and Canada have walked away after crunching the numbers. So why is India still eager to host the CwG again? We answered that in Friday’s newsletter .

The Story India has just thrown its hat in the ring to host the Commonwealth Games (CwG) in 2030, which will be a milestone year marking the 100th anniversary of the event. And its main or rather, the only competitor is Nigeria. Both countries have put in formal bids, with Ahmedabad named as India’s proposed host city. But the decision about who gets to do the honours will only come in November. That’s the big headline. But here’s the quieter part of the story. Until a few months ago, nearly five countries were in the race to host the 2030 Games. Today, it’s down to just two. The rest backed out, and the reason was the same as always: the costs just didn’t add up. Take Canada, for instance. It flirted with the idea of bidding but backed out when its provinces pushed back. Alberta’s government pegged the price tag at over CAD$2.68 billion ($1.9 billion) and declared it “not a good deal” for taxpayers. And their hesitation wasn’t without reason. They may have been influenced by Australia’s Victoria Province who walked away from the 2026 Games because their initial budget of A$2.6 billion ($1.77 billion) had ballooned to over A$7 billion ($4.77 billion). So if costs can more than double even before the opening ceremony, you can see why other countries are spooked. Sponsorships and broadcast rights don’t bring in enough to bridge the gap. In fact, more than 90% of the financial risk typically falls on the government, which really means taxpayers footing the bill. The proof is in the pudding. Business Standard crunched the numbers and found that commercial returns for host cities have been sliding for decades. To put things in perspective, back in 2002, Manchester managed to recover 46% of its operating costs through sponsorships and media deals. But by the time we got to Gold Coast 2018 and Birmingham 2022, that figure had fallen to under 20%. No wonder fewer countries want to host the Games. In fact, there’s even been chatter that if things don’t change, Glasgow 2026 could be the last-ever CwG. So, if hosting the CwG is such a money-losing proposition, why is India so eager to host it, you ask? Well, you might say, “Come on, Finshots, this one’s obvious. Big events leave behind shiny new infrastructure, create jobs, bring in tourists and give a boost to small businesses too. So even if the Games don’t rake in huge profits directly, the economy benefits in the long run.” Sounds fair. But here’s the catch. This argument isn’t always as solid as it seems. And a bunch of smart folks at The Conversation have explained why. See, most of the rosy economic studies are done before the Games, mainly to build a case for hosting them. Take Sydney 2000 for example. Ahead of the Olympics, KPMG told the New South Wales government that the Games would deliver over $7 billion in benefits. But once the Games are over, detailed follow-up studies are rare. So you don’t really know if those projections ever came true. Curious about this gap, their researchers decided to run the numbers on Sydney’s Olympics after the Games. And their findings weren’t exactly gold-medal worthy. They discovered that the 2000 Olympics actually reduced Australia’s real private and public consumption by about $3.7 billion (adjusted to 2023 prices) over the nine years the Games influenced the economy. So, what went wrong? Enter two basic economics lessons: the crowding-out effect and opportunity cost. The crowding-out effect is when government spending pushes private spending aside. In Sydney’s case, regular tourists stayed away because hotel and flight prices shot up, crowds clogged the city and everything got pricier. So instead of adding new economic activity, the Games displaced existing activity. Then comes opportunity cost — the idea that money spent on one thing could’ve been better used elsewhere. Sydney poured $5.2 billion into the Olympics. Strip out the revenues and the net direct cost (in today’s money) was about $4.5 billion. And remember, this wasn’t private money. It was taxpayer cash. Which meant funds that could’ve gone into other programmes like schools or hospitals — things that create lasting benefits, were redirected into Olympic venues. Resources like labour and materials were pulled away from more productive uses too. To make matters worse, governments often raise taxes, borrow more, or cut other spending to finance such events. And all of that eats into household disposable income, leaving people with less to spend. So yeah, hosting the Olympics or CwG might bring intangible perks like national pride and unity. But those perks come with a very real, and very heavy, price tag. So maybe India’s desire to host the CwG isn’t just about money. It’s a bit like buying a house. Sure, it’s a practical necessity. But since it’s a once-in-a-lifetime decision, people often end up splurging a few extra lakhs. Why? Because owning a home isn’t just about utility, it’s about status. It’s about being able to tell your friends and family, “This is mine.” It changes how people look at you because it’s a marker of success in society. India’s thinking is not too different. Hosting the centenary edition of the CwG is less about profits and more about prestige. It’s about stepping into the global spotlight and saying, “We’ve arrived.” After all, India is the world’s fourth-largest economy and has its eyes on climbing to second place by 2038, ahead of Japan, Germany and even the US. To get there, building soft power and global visibility matters just as much as GDP numbers. Then there’s the promise of transformation at home. The Games could spark fresh investment in world-class stadiums, transport and urban amenities, particularly in Ahmedabad and Gujarat. They could also act as a catalyst to get young Indians more engaged in sport, inspiring the next generation to embrace athletic excellence, fitness and healthier lifestyles. These things go beyond economics and the kind of intangible benefits you can’t always measure, but they matter just the same. But here’s the thing again. If India really wants to pull this off, there’s one crucial rule — avoid the scandals that could wreck our image and undo everything. And you probably know what we’re hinting at. The 2010 CwG in Delhi wasn’t exactly our proudest moment. The event was marred by shoddy organisation , delays and above all, financial scandals. Inflated contracts and wasteful spending meant costs spiralled out of control. To give you a sense of scale, when India bid for the 2010 Games back in 2003, the budget was pegged at around ₹1,200 crores . By the time the Games wrapped up, costs had exploded by more than 1,400%! That’s the sort of thing we can’t afford to repeat if we want to build soft power of the right kind. Instead, maybe the real benchmarks for India should be something like the 2014 Glasgow Games. Unlike many other big sporting events, Glasgow avoided White Elephant venues — those flashy, expensive stadiums that sit empty, cost a fortune to maintain, and sometimes even end up being demolished. Instead, the city focused on infrastructure that would serve people long after the Games were over. From day one, there was a legacy plan. The Athletes’ Village, for instance, was built to residential standards, and once the Games wrapped up, it was converted into about 1,400 homes — a mix of private and affordable housing — in the long-neglected district of Dalmarnock. Or take Birmingham 2022. They actually managed to finish the Games with a £70 million underspend . And instead of letting that money vanish into bureaucratic cracks, they decided to reinvest it back into the region. So, maybe if we take a leaf out of these CwG playbooks, we’ll be able to derive those intangible benefits that come from the world knowing India for the right reasons. Else, with public money wasted, our image will risk being tarnished too. Hopefully, things will pan out better this time. Fingers crossed. 🤞🏽 Until then… Correction: A previous version of this story erroneously mentioned India as the fifth largest economy instead of the fourth.

The Story I recently moved to a new home in the city from a small town. And if you’ve ever felt the bittersweet thrill of stepping into a new space, you’ll know exactly what I mean. There’s that heady rush of having a place of your own — even if it’s rented, and then the dull thud of reality that follows. Because if the house hasn’t been lived in for a while, chances are you’re walking into a dust bowl. But instead of panicking, I just booked a full home cleaning service on the Urban Company app (formerly known as Urban Clap, but we’ll call it UC from here). Before I even entered the house, three professionals were already at my door. A few hours later, the cobwebs were gone, the house smelled fresh and I could unpack without breaking into a sweat. Which is why, when UC announced its IPO this week, I couldn’t help but dig into its Red Herring Prospectus . So, let’s talk about it. It’s a ₹1,900 crore issue. Out of this, ₹1,428 crores is an offer for sale (OFS) by existing investors like Accel India, Bessemer India Capital Holdings and a few others. The remaining ₹472 crores will flow directly into UC’s kitty. They’ll use it for building new tech and cloud infrastructure, paying leases for offices, marketing and other corporate expenses. But before you even think of putting your money into it, you probably want to know — what exactly does UC do? Now, I don’t need to tell you because chances are you’ve used it or at least heard of it. But for the sake of formality, here’s the gist. UC is basically a platform that lets you order services like cleaning, pest control, electricians, plumbers, carpenters, appliance repairs, grooming, skincare, massages, painting, you name it. These services are delivered by trained, independent professionals right at your doorstep. Think of it as the Swiggy or Zomato of on-demand home services. For the professionals, UC is a godsend. Earlier, they had to rely on word-of-mouth or family recommendations to find customers in their neighbourhoods. With UC, they get visibility, training and a steady stream of bookings. All they have to do is get onboarded, complete the training and start taking orders, while UC takes a cut from the overall transaction. It’s a win-win for everyone as customers get reliable service at their convenience, professionals get more work and UC takes a slice of every transaction and makes more money in the process. So how much money does UC make, you ask? In FY25, UC’s revenue from operations stood at ₹1,144 crores. That’s grown at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34% since FY23. And it’s not just topline growth. The company has tapped into the classic “network effect”. Here’s how that works. You book a cleaning service, and if it’s good, two things happen. One, you’re tempted to try other UC services. Two, you tell your friends. That word-of-mouth brings more customers to the platform. Add to this the fact that UC has smartly broken down its offerings into micro-market services — say, just cleaning a kitchen instead of the whole house, or getting your geyser checked before being sure that it needs to be serviced or repaired, and suddenly, people are using UC more often. It’s affordable, convenient and accessible. The proof? Repeat customers! In FY23, 76% of UC’s users came back for more. By FY25, that figure had climbed to 82%. That kind of stickiness is gold for any platform business. And UC isn’t resting on its core offerings. It has been experimenting and diversifying. Take InstaHelp, launched in January. It’s meant to fill in when your regular domestic help takes a day off. Professionals can show up within 15 minutes of booking to handle daily chores like cleaning, laundry, or even basic meal prep and cooking. Then there’s Native, UC’s foray into home solutions. They’ve started selling water purifiers and electronic door locks under this brand because they think that water contamination is a rising concern thanks to pollution and climate change, and electronic locks are an emerging category as people swap keys for passcodes, fingerprints and remote unlocks. Plus, UC isn’t just Indian anymore. It has expanded to markets like the UAE, Singapore and Saudi Arabia. In these places, house-help is expensive, sometimes legally tricky and often comes with privacy or safety concerns. So UC offers subscription-based cleaning and home services — weekly or bi-weekly visits by licensed professionals, tailored for these markets. So far, so good. But what’ll really make you sit up is the magic UC has pulled off with its profits. You see, back in FY23, UC reported a net loss of ₹312 crores. But fast-forward to FY25, and suddenly it’s showing a profit of ₹240 crores. That’s a jaw-dropping turnaround, which makes you ask — how did they pull this off? Well, three big reasons. First, steady revenue growth, as we’ve seen. Second, cost discipline. While revenues shot up at a 34% CAGR, expenses inched up by just 9%. That’s a clear sign UC is getting smarter with costs. Take training expenses, for instance. It dropped from ₹12 crores in FY23 to ₹8 crores in FY25. Probably because as the platform matured, training became more streamlined and scalable. Think online modules instead of costly classrooms, digital upskilling instead of endless in-person sessions. All of that brought the average cost per partner down. And finally, there’s the big one — a one-time ₹211 crore deferred tax credit. This basically happens when the income recorded in the books is higher than what’s calculated under the Income Tax Act. So UC would’ve already paid more tax earlier and got a credit for it now. Strip that out, and profits still stand at about ₹28 crores. Sure, that may not sound like a blockbuster figure, but it’s still a solid turnaround as long as UC keeps growing steadily and spending wisely. The one thing that doesn’t look all that impressive, though, is UC’s operating profit margin. It’s barely 1%. And that’s largely because its new ventures — Native products and its international operations, are still bleeding money. For now, those losses are being cushioned by profits from its bread-and-butter Indian services segment. And with no listed peer or direct competitor to compare it against, it’s tough to say whether this margin is good, bad, or just par for the course. That said, the good bit is that competition isn’t breathing down UC’s neck just yet. Sure, there are plenty of small regional players trying to match customers with service professionals, but no one else has built a national presence quite like UC. The closest you get is Quikr’s Zimmber , but that hasn’t been too active lately. What’s more interesting, though, is that Swiggy is quietly testing the waters with its own AI-powered platform called Pyng . And if Swiggy gets serious, UC might suddenly find itself up against a rival with deep pockets, a massive customer base and the ability to scale quickly. And that’s when things can get tricky. If UC tries to fight back by diversifying into too many segments, it risks losing sight of what made it successful in the first place — being a simple, reliable bridge between customers and professionals. We’ve seen how this story plays out when we recently wrote about EaseMyTrip , for instance. Its attempt to spread itself thin confused both customers and investors, and the stock paid the price. And UC might want to avoid walking down that path. But even if competition feels like a problem for tomorrow, there are risks UC faces today. The first one’s pretty straightforward — customers bypassing the platform altogether. Say you book a service through UC, and you really like the professional. Next time, instead of going through the app, you might just call them directly. For you, it’s cheaper. For the professional, it means a higher payout since they don’t have to share a cut with UC. Sure, the platform does try to clamp down on this with strict rules. But let’s be real. This isn’t unavoidable. Then there’s the pushback from service professionals themselves. UC calls them independent contractors, not employees. But not everyone agrees. In FY24, gig worker unions across states filed complaints with labour offices, arguing that UC exercises so much control — through ratings, bookings and tiers — that it feels like an employer-employee relationship. And they want better benefits to go with it. Look closer at the pay, and you can see why. The average hourly earning is ₹317. Sounds decent, right? But even the top 5% of professionals earn the same per hour. The only reason they take home more each month is that they bag more bookings, thanks to higher visibility on the platform. See, UC runs a tier system with Bronze, Silver and Gold tiers for professionals, where better ratings and reliability unlock more jobs. But here’s the catch. Even a tiny dip, say 0.01 in your rating, could push you down a tier, cutting your discoverability and income. No wonder some workers aren’t thrilled. And this risk could only grow. The government is beginning to recognise the importance of gig workers in the economy, and policies around social security like provident fund contributions and mandatory licensing are slowly gaining ground. That’s fantastic for the workers, but for UC, it could mean higher costs and thinner margins. And finally, the thing we haven’t spoken about yet is the valuation. UC’s asking price comes in at about 12x its sales . That’s broadly in line with global peers but still feels a bit steep compared to smaller domestic players (which aren’t completely comparable). But then again, UC does have something no one else in India has — a national brand, strong recall and first-mover advantage. So if you look at it from that lens, maybe that premium isn’t entirely out of place. But if that doesn’t bother you and you’re still eyeing this IPO, just remember — there are plenty of unknowns ahead. New rivals could pop up, the market could shift and UC’s story might take a very different or even an ugly turn. For now, it looks like an exciting bet, but what happens once the stock hits the bourses is anybody’s guess. Until then… Fun fact: In 2020, Urban Clap changed its name to Urban Company because it wanted to expand to international markets and felt that the name was more appealing. But honestly, that didn’t make sense to me, so I went digging. And what I found out was weird. The term ‘clap’ is also another name for gonorrhoea, a sexually transmitted disease. Not exactly the kind of association you’d want when going global, right? So the switch to Urban Company wasn’t just about being professional, it was also about avoiding awkward branding. Smart call, if you ask me. If this story helped you understand how UC works beyond the app, don’t forget to share it with your friends, family or even strangers on WhatsApp , LinkedIn and X .

How can India solve this?,"8 September 2025 • Macro The world’s running out of natural rubber. How can India solve this? In today’s Finshots, we follow a humble tree sap from plantation to tyre, and ask why a material we barely notice could become the next strategic squeeze point like oil or semiconductors. But before we begin, if you’re someone who loves to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance, then hit subscribe if you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story. The Story Every time you ride a scooter, cross a bridge, or slip on a surgical glove, you’re depending on a drop of white sap tapped from a tree in Southeast Asia. It isn’t glamorous like oil or semiconductors, but natural rubber quietly underpins everything from tyres, conveyor belts, and even healthcare supplies. And the world is running short of it. The global demand for natural rubber is on track to outstrip supply for the fifth straight year. The Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries ( ANRPC ), often described as the OPEC of rubber, has already warned that output growth is stagnating even as consumption keeps climbing. But this isn’t something we can solve immediately. You see, the problem is rooted in biology. Rubber trees take six to seven years before they can be harvested. So, we can’t immediately increase supply when demand rises. For much of the last decade, prices were so low that farmers abandoned plantations for more lucrative crops, and that gap is now starting to widen. That wouldn’t be such a big deal if production were spread around the world. The risk could have been distributed so that it wouldn’t create as much of a shock. However, more than 75% of natural rubber comes from Southeast Asia. Mainly Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Malaysia. That geographical concentration makes the entire industry one fungus or cyclone away from a meltdown. And currently, a leaf disease called Pestalotiopsis is already hurting Indonesian plantations by reducing yields by almost half . If it mutates or spreads across borders, global inventories could thin quickly. Add in the erratic rainfall and heat spikes of climate change, and the risks only multiply. Expanding plantations by clearing more land sounds like an easy fix, except it runs straight into deforestation rules and public pressure. And you also end up with the classic monoculture and a more concentrated supply, which, again, is not good. So yeah, it’s a tough industry for customers as well as suppliers. Which makes us ask, where does India stand amongst all this? In 2023–24, India’s rubber output was around 0.86 million tonnes against a consumption of 1.42 million tonnes. That leaves us importing nearly 40% of what we need, even as tyre makers are having a moment with exports topping ₹25,000 crore in FY25 . A global squeeze flows straight into domestic costs. And this isn’t some distant concern. If you build cars, trucks, roads, bridges, or medical devices, chances are rubber sits somewhere in your bill of materials. Now you’re probably wondering: If rubber is so important, why can’t we just use a synthetic version of it? After all, it’s made from petroleum and is widely available. Well, it’s not like we haven’t tried it. Synthetic rubber is a major component of car tyres, footwear, washers, etc. But natural rubber still wins on resilience, elasticity, and heat dispersion. Aircraft tyres that face brutal take-off loads, truck tyres that run hot for hours, conveyor belts in steel plants, seismic bearings under bridges, surgical gloves, catheters, condoms – for many of these, synthetics are not good enough or become too expensive once you engineer around their shortcomings. This is why the stakes go far beyond consumer goods. Rubber underwrites supply chains, defence readiness, and public health. In fact, during the Second World War, the fall of Southeast Asian plantations to the Japanese nearly paralysed the Allies until they fast-tracked synthetic rubber programmes. A modern shortage may not play out the same way, but it would rhyme. Countries will rethink sourcing, build buffers, and start treating rubber as a strategic resource rather than just another agricultural commodity. So, how can we come out ahead? Because for India, this risk is exactly what presents an opening. Southeast Asia will remain the core producer because the trees are already there. But India can carve out a profitable niche. And a quiet shift is happening in the North-East. Tripura, Assam, and Meghalaya now contribute about 17% of domestic rubber output, up from just 7.8% a decade ago. The land is less congested, and new logistics corridors are enabling the region to be part of the national supply chain. And from late 2025, the European Union’s anti-deforestation rules (EUDR) will require plot-level traceability for rubber imports. At first glance, that looks like a headache. However, in practice, it could be a premium. Because buyers in Europe, whether tyre or medical latex makers, will pay more for clean paperwork than risk regulatory penalties. But you can’t fake it. You need geo-tagged plots, a digital chain-of-custody, and clear audit trails. All of this is what the Indian government is also working towards. The Rubber Board has launched geospatial mapping, traceability tools, and the BSNR platform to streamline compliance. The prize goes to whoever can scale quality and compliance fastest, and not just by planting more trees. That means the play for India is not to chase acreage alone, but to own more of the value chain. Expansion in the North-East can happen even on degraded land through agroforestry, supported by survival-linked subsidies that pay out over several years rather than one-time grants. New disease- and heat-resistant clones need to move from labs to nurseries to farms with proper extension support. Better tapping/harvesting techniques can turn each tree into a more productive asset. And small landholders need access to steady working capital, so they aren’t forced to dump latex at a discount just to meet cash flow. The next step is to climb the ladder in processing. More technically specified rubber, more medical-grade latex, more specialised tyre and non-tyre components, and a stronger reclaimed rubber industry that turns scrap into feedstock. Not to mention that India is already one of the largest dumping grounds for used tyres from around the world, which means the raw material for recycling is literally landing at our ports. And this is only going to increase: The reclaimed rubber market was about $278 million in 2023 and could grow to $1.2 billion by 2035 . It’s not glamorous work, but it reduces import dependence and cushions volatility. It also reduces waste. Every tonne of reclaimed rubber that replaces a virgin supply is one tonne less exposed to global shocks. And finally, compliance itself can become a selling point. An EU-ready traceability backbone that geo-tags plots, logs harvest data, and ties shipments into digital custody chains can make Indian exports look very different from others. Once a few exporters start earning a premium for clean lots, the practice will spread, and the same rails can also reassure domestic buyers who deal with global clients. India can be the steady, transparent, higher-value ecosystem that tyre makers and healthcare suppliers turn to when the world is tight. Even if we still import raw material, we can monetise the squeeze by moving up the chain. Over time, our import share may fall, but our premium share of value can rise faster. Because at the end of the day, the world really is running short of natural rubber. Biology is slow, the weather is noisy, and the supply is concentrated. India can profit, but only if we play the long game on quality and compliance rather than the short game on acreage. Until then… Don’t forget to share it on WhatsApp , LinkedIn and X .

https://finshots.in/archive/jammed-planes-why-us-likes-corks-and-more,2025-09-07,Sunny Side Up,"Jammed planes, why US likes corks and more...","7 September 2025 • Sunny Side Up Jammed planes, why US likes corks and more... Hey folks! Something unusual has happened in the saga of the US slapping tariffs on countries left, right and centre. Corks or the humble bottle stoppers made from the bark of cork oak trees, coming in from the EU, have been spared with no tariffs . Now, you might wonder why we’re making this look like a big deal. Well, cork has been officially tagged in the US-EU trade agreement as an “unavailable natural product”. And such carve-outs are rare, which makes this little cork exception all the more interesting. So why is cork so special, you ask? For starters, the US is the world’s fourth-largest wine producer, responsible for about 10% of global supply . And wine needs corks. They seal bottles just right — letting in a tiny amount of oxygen so the wine ages gracefully. That’s why nearly 65% of premium American wines use cork stoppers. But here’s the catch. Almost all of them come from Portugal, the world’s cork powerhouse. In fact, after France, the US is Portugal’s biggest cork customer. Okay, but can’t the US just make its own corks? Well, not really. Cork might look simple, but producing it isn’t. Cork oak trees grow mainly in the Mediterranean and don’t take well to being transplanted to the US. Even if they did, the wait is brutal — 25 years for the first harvestable bark, and then another 9 years before you can strip it again. And harvesting isn’t a factory job either. It takes skilled hands to carefully peel the bark without killing the tree. In fact, the US actually gave this a shot during World War II, when cork was in huge demand for tanks, planes, weapon systems and even refrigerated containers. With supply chains squeezed, they tried planting cork oaks domestically. But between the painfully long growth cycle and the lack of skilled harvesters, the experiment fizzled out. Sure, there are substitutes like screw caps, but most vintners (winemakers) still swear by cork since it’s sustainable, biodegradable and most importantly, it keeps the wine happy. So when the US slapped a 15% tariff on most EU imports, cork was left untouched. Because let’s face it. If cork gets expensive, it’s American wine that takes the hit. And no one in Washington wants that. In the end, the exemption is a win-win. Portugal keeps selling cork. And the US quietly protects its own wine industry. Smart, isn’t it? Here’s a soundtrack to put you in the mood 🎵 Swali Hu by Donn Bhat You can thank our reader, Monu Arora, for this lovely rec. Ready to roll? What caught our eye this week 👀 Planes get jammed and what’s saving them There are few things more unnerving than being on a plane when the screens in the cockpit suddenly go out and the pilots announce they can’t figure out which direction to fly because the navigation is jammed. But that’s what happened a few days back as Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission President, flew into Bulgaria. One minute the aircraft was happily following polite instructions from satellites thousands of kilometres above, the next it was as if someone had switched the world off. Next? Well, the pilots seemed cool as they ditched the screens and landed like it was 1985 with the help of paper maps!! EU officials were less amused though. They suspect the GPS was jammed in a Russian operation. Like the ones Moscow uses to confuse Ukrainian drones. According to Bulgarian officials, though, this has become so frequent that individual cases like von der Leyen's are no longer specially investigated. So how does this jamming actually work? GPS signals are incredibly faint, like a light bulb seen from space. A jammer on the ground simply screams louder on the same frequency, drowning them out. Think karaoke night, where someone grabs the mic and drowns out the singer. Only this time, the song is your navigation. “Spoofers” take it further: they don’t just shout; they sing the wrong song, tricking planes into believing they’re somewhere they’re not. And this isn’t rare. NATO’s logged nearly 80 incidents of GPS interference in Europe this year alone. Estonia says 85% of flights have had GPS disruptions. Lithuania, meanwhile, has seen a 22-fold spike in a year. And the scariest part? Jammers don’t cost much. So, countries like those in Europe are betting big on the EU Galileo space project, its own constellation of satellites, more accurate than GPS and with encrypted signals that are harder to jam. India’s building too. Its NavIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation) covers the subcontinent and Indian Ocean. It’s already mandatory in new commercial vehicles and slowly edging into smartphones. Unlike GPS, NavIC uses multiple frequencies, which makes it more resilient to interference, and, crucially, gives India its own sovereign navigation system. Meanwhile, the anti-jamming industry is booming — worth $4 billion in 2023, projected to more than double by 2030. The cheeky truth? Maybe it’s that we’ve grown too used to satellite signals. Flights, ships, farms, even our phones — everything assumes the system will never fail. But this incident was a reminder that these invisible threads are fragile, and modern wars can spill quietly into everyday skies. Which is why backups matter. Be it old maps, alternate systems, even plain human skill! Infographic 📊 📺India’s Healthcare Crisis: Why you’re paying more for less India’s healthcare sector is booming, with hospitals raking in record profits. But here’s the catch. Patients are struggling to find beds, and access to basic services is shrinking. So how is it that hospitals are making more money than ever, yet accessibility seems to be at an all-time low? In this episode of Finshots TV, we break down the shocking truth behind India’s healthcare crisis, from private equity firms driving up profits by prioritising high-margin procedures, to the complex game of patient allocation. Click here to check it out . Readers Recommend 🗒️ This week, our reader Chinmay Agarwal, recommends reading Cobalt Red by Siddharth Kara. He says, I recently finished reading Cobalt Red by Siddharth Kara... Cobalt Red is not an easy read — and that’s precisely why it’s so important. Siddharth Kara does not hesitate to present the truth in its rawest, most unfiltered form. His direct, first-hand accounts of child labour, human trafficking, and environmental destruction in the cobalt mines of the Democratic Republic of Congo leave a lasting impact. This is not just a book filled with statistics or secondhand stories; it’s a deeply human narrative that forces you to confront the uncomfortable realities behind the technology we use every day... This book made me pause and reflect on my own privilege. While some of us worry about charging our devices or upgrading to the latest phone, there are children digging through toxic earth with their bare hands, just to survive. Cobalt Red is a rare and vital reminder that behind every convenience lies a cost — one that is too often paid by those whose stories are rarely told. It’s not just a book — it’s a wake-up call. And it deserves to be read widely. Thanks for the rec, Chinmay! Finshots Weekly Quiz 🧠 It’s time to announce the winner of our previous weekly quiz. And the winner is…🥁 Arijit Singharoy!

And in this week’s Markets Edition , we dive into why EaseMyTrip’s stock price has been nosediving for a while now. Click here to read the full story . With that out of the way, let’s recap what we wrote this week. How Mahindra became India’s 2nd biggest carmaker For decades, India was a hatchback country, and Maruti and Hyundai ruled while SUVs looked like niche toys. But the tide has turned in the last few years. Compact SUVs became aspirational yet affordable, taxes favoured them, and Mahindra was already positioned as an SUV-first company. And in February, it even leapfrogged Hyundai to grab the No. 2 spot in overall sales. But this wasn’t just luck. It was a story of matching strategy to market shifts, focusing on what customers want, and executing on scale and efficiency in a deeply competitive industry. And to know how Mahindra did this, you can check out our Monday newsletter here . Why cancer care is becoming private hospitals’ biggest driver Cancer is one of India’s fastest-growing health crises with over 15 lakh new cases last year alone. But public infrastructure is buckling under shortages of equipment, doctors, and funding. Private hospitals, meanwhile, have spotted the gap and are investing in high-end machines, luring top oncologists, and packaging treatments under one roof. That’s why oncology is now Max Healthcare’s single biggest specialty, and Fortis has doubled down too. But what does this say about the future of healthcare in India? And what can be done about it? That’s what we explore in our Tuesday’s story . Gold is the new treasury? For the first time in 30 years, central banks are holding more gold than US Treasuries. The trigger? Rising inflation that erodes bond returns, the fear of sanctions, and a mountain of US debt that looks shakier by the day. Even India’s RBI has pulled back 100 tonnes from overseas vaults. All of this changes a few things for the markets as well as investors. And if the very people who mint money are hedging with gold, what should the rest of us take away from that? We broke it down in our Wednesday’s story here . Kraft Heinz wants to press ‘undo’ When Warren Buffett and 3G Capital stitched together Kraft and Heinz in 2015, it was supposed to be a food empire blending cheese and ketchup into a $90 billion powerhouse. Instead, the company bled market share, underinvested in its brands, and missed shifting consumer tastes. Now, nearly a decade later, Kraft Heinz wants to split back into two and it’s spending $300 million just on the undo. But will this fix the mess or simply mark the end of a failed experiment? You can read our Thursday’s explainer here to know more. Trump Media wants to corner a cryptocurrency called Cronos! Donald Trump’s media company just announced a $6.4 billion plan to hoard nearly a fifth of all Cronos tokens and run a validator node. The pitch? Treat it like a corporate “digital asset treasury.” But here’s the thing. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, Cronos’s fortunes are tied tightly to Crypto.com’s ecosystem, raising big questions on risk and reward for Trump’s crypto ambitions. And the bigger question is: Can you really monopolise a blockchain and still keep it alive? We unpack it all in Friday’s newsletter .

https://finshots.in/markets/whats-going-on-at-easemytrip-emt-nishant-pitti-prashant-pitti-rikant-pitti,2025-09-05,Markets,What's going on at EaseMyTrip?,"5 September 2025 • Markets What's going on at EaseMyTrip? In today’s Finshots, we tell you why EaseMyTrip is amid a financial decline and its stock isn’t sure which way to swing. The Story When EaseMyTrip went public in 2021, it was one of those IPOs that everyone wanted a piece of. The buzz was massive. The issue was oversubscribed 160 times , and when the stock finally hit the markets, it listed with a neat 11% gain. But the real magic was what came after. Within a year, anyone who had invested in the IPO was sitting on a 320% return . It was the kind of high that makes investors feel invincible. But fast forward to today, things are looking very different for the company that once found itself on the prestigious list of India’s first 100 unicorns and prided itself on being the only consistently profitable new-age tech business on the stock exchanges. For context, just three years ago, when EaseMyTrip (or EMT, as most people call it) was the darling of investors, its market capitalisation had peaked at around ₹11,700 crores . Today, more than 70% of that has been wiped out. The stock has been on a steady decline too, and investors are left wondering — what went wrong? For starters, sales in EMT’s bread-and-butter business — flight ticket bookings — have taken a nosedive. Now, this is important because historically, EMT earned nearly all of its revenues from flights. In fact, at one point, 99% of its net revenue came from selling flight tickets. But between 2023 and 2025, this segment shrank sharply. The proof is in the pudding. In Q1FY26 alone, flight revenues fell 47% compared to the same quarter last year, and 40% compared to the previous quarter. And if you’re wondering what caused this sharp drop, well, competition. A lot of it. Post-pandemic, rivals like MakeMyTrip, the undisputed leader in India’s OTA (online travel agency) space, as well as newer challengers like Ixigo and Yatra, realised they couldn’t survive on ticketing alone. They expanded into hotels and holiday packages. They bundled discounts. They offered deals that covered more than just flights. And that strategy worked. Customers got better value, and EMT suddenly found itself on the losing side of the bargain. To counter this, EMT decided it couldn’t just keep slashing ticket prices forever. So, it unveiled a new strategy — EMT 2.0. The idea was to diversify, to expand beyond flights into higher-margin businesses like hotels, holidays, EV manufacturing, medical tourism, even film production and distribution. The plan was ambitious. EMT wanted to buy up to 49% stakes in profitable companies across these sectors and ride on their growth. But ambition often comes with baggage. This sudden shift away from its core travel business created a new problem. Corporate clients, who relied on EMT for straightforward ticketing, began to feel alienated. And the spree of acquisitions, worth over ₹370 crores , meant that the company was burning through cash. Worse, many of these businesses were only vaguely related to travel. Tech-enabled hospitality, luxury intercity travel, even film distribution… the dots didn’t quite connect. The end result was that instead of spreading risk, diversification diluted focus. Expenses piled up, revenues didn’t keep pace, and the management’s attention drifted away from its stronghold as a plain-vanilla OTA. The financials paint a grim picture too. At its peak in 2022 , EMT boasted industry-leading margins — 58% EBITDA and 42% PAT. But by FY25, those numbers had collapsed to 26% and 20%, respectively. And then came another blow — reputation. EMT’s name got dragged, albeit indirectly, into the Mahadev betting scam. The company wasn’t directly implicated, but rumours and media reports linking parts of the ecosystem to shady dealings were enough to spook investors. In times of trouble, even the slightest whiff of controversy can erode trust. And this did exactly that. As if that wasn’t enough, EMT was also struggling with collections. In simple terms, it was taking longer to get money back from customers and partners. Slow payments meant cash flow problems. And when cash flow dries up, it becomes harder to pay bills, invest in growth, or even manage day-to-day operations. Meanwhile, leadership saw its own shake-up. Prashant Pitti, co-founder and managing director, stepped down recently. His exit came amid declining promoter shareholding and financial turbulence, leaving Nishant Pitti in charge. Now, promoter stake sales are always tricky — when insiders, in this case Nishant Pitti himself, reduce their holdings, investors often see it as a lack of confidence. Even if the Pittis claimed it was portfolio rebalancing, the optics weren’t great. All these problems eventually showed up where it hurts most: the stock market. The share price kept tumbling, signalling that even those closest to the business weren’t entirely sure of where it was headed. So maybe, at its heart, this is a story of a company that got carried away. From being an efficient, focused travel platform, EMT tried to become too many things at once. The diversification lacked a clear direction, the acquisitions lacked synergy, and the core business bled in the process. But here’s the thing. The Pitti brothers don’t think the game is over. They still believe that their big bets will pay off in the long run. EMT’s push into hotels, holiday packages, and even international markets like Dubai shows early signs of growth. These segments are scaling fast, and if they mature, they could help the company regain its footing. And while thinking long term is a good thing, the problem though, is one of identity. To investors, EMT doesn’t look like a straightforward OTA anymore. It looks like a company experimenting with anything and everything in the hope of boosting margins. And when your story isn’t clear, investors get nervous. So yeah, the way forward may not be rocket science. EMT might just need to go back to basics — refocus on what it does best, streamline costs, avoid distracting acquisitions, and rebuild the trust it once commanded. Whether the Pitti brothers can pull that off is anyone’s guess. Until then… Don’t forget to share this story on WhatsApp , LinkedIn and X . How Strong Is Your Financial Plan?

https://finshots.in/archive/trump-media-wants-to-corner-a-cryptocurrency-called-cronos,2025-09-05,Macro,Trump Media wants to corner a cryptocurrency called Cronos!,"5 September 2025 • Macro Trump Media wants to corner a cryptocurrency called Cronos! In today’s Finshots, we look at Trump Media’s $6.4 billion bet on an altcoin called Cronos, and why history suggests this story may not end well. But before we begin, if you’re someone who loves to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance, then hit subscribe if you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story. The Story Imagine you’re on Dalal Street and someone whispers that a mysterious investor plans to buy up nearly all the stock of Hindustan Unilever (HUL). Not a few shares. A fifth of the company in one shot, and more if possible. Now, HUL is India’s FMCG giant with a market cap of about ₹6 trillion. So, if a single whale hoovers up that much stock, what happens? At first, prices soar. Traders cheer. “If this whale wants in, there must be value,” they think. The stock jumps, the whale looks richer on paper, and for a while everyone feels smarter. But the risk is that when one player holds so much, liquidity dries up. Others hesitate to trade. And if the whale ever needs to sell, the very act of selling could crush the price. Worse, if this whale is a listed company, its own stock begins to mirror every tick in HUL’s chart. A reflexive loop emerges. The company’s fate becomes hostage to the very stock it hoarded. So yeah, the plan sounds reckless. But Donald Trump’s media company did something eerily similar last week. Not with any listed company, but with a little-known cryptocurrency called Cronos (CRO). Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (DJT), which runs Truth Social and where Donald Trump holds a 53% stake, announced a deal with Crypto.com and Yorkville to set up a $6.4 billion “ CRO digital asset treasury .” The plan: start with a $1 billion stash of CRO — nearly 19% of all tokens in circulation — plus $200 million in cash, $220 million in warrants, and a $5 billion credit line. In short, a $6.4 billion vehicle worth about as much as the coin it’s trying to corner. On paper, it isn’t just hoarding. Trump Media says it will run a validator node on the Cronos blockchain. What’s that? Well, think of a validator as a cricket umpire, ensuring that every ball is fair. In crypto, validators confirm transactions and earn new tokens in return. Trump Media calls this proof that CRO can be an “income-generating asset.” But here’s the problem. CRO isn’t positioned like Bitcoin, a store of value. Nor Ethereum, which powers thousands of apps and smart contracts. CRO is mostly tied to Crypto.com’s ecosystem. It’s the fuel that makes the Cronos chain run that supports NFTs and Web3 ecosystems. As the filing puts it… Cronos is a high performance, interoperable blockchain designed for speed, scalability, and seamless connectivity between networks, making it a strong foundation for the future American digital economy. It enables low-cost, high-speed smart contract deployment and smooth integration with other major blockchain ecosystems, unlocking widescale adoption of decentralized applications in finance, commerce, and public infrastructure, without the congestion or costs of legacy networks. With its proof-of-authority consensus, robust validator set, and enterprise-grade security, Cronos delivers the performance and reliability needed to power mission-critical applications at scale. You pay fees in it, you stake it to validators, you secure the network. Which means the more CRO circulates, the healthier the system. Which is why locking away nearly a fifth in a vault is… odd. Simply put, it’s like buying all the fuel in Delhi to prove petrol prices are rising—and then wondering why the traffic stopped. Now if all of this sounds familiar, it’s because it’s the same playbook American entrepreneur, Michael Saylor, used at MicroStrategy. You see, in 2020, MicroStrategy, a struggling software firm, reinvented itself by buying billions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin . Its balance sheet became a mirror of Bitcoin’s price. Investors treated it like a proxy ETF. But this strategy only works as long as the Bitcoin tide keeps rising. The moment Bitcoin prices dip, MicroStrategy’s leverage cuts both ways. Debt balloons, collateral shrinks, and shareholders panic. But let me tell you a parable from history. In the late 1970s, two Texas oil heirs, Nelson and William Hunt, decided silver was the trade of the century. Convinced paper money was doomed, they went all-in. With mountains of borrowed cash, they bought futures, hoarded bullion, and even shipped bars to Swiss vaults to stay ahead of US regulators. By early 1980, they controlled nearly 200 million ounces… or almost a third of the world’s deliverable silver! At first, it looked unstoppable. Silver shot from $6 an ounce in 1979 to nearly $50 by January 1980. And on paper, the Hunts were worth over billions. But corners rarely survived regulators. Alarmed, COMEX and the Chicago Board of Trade made it harder to keep buying silver by asking traders to put up more cash as margins. And since the Hunts had borrowed heavily, they couldn’t meet these demands. On 27 March 1980, known as “Silver Thursday”, silver prices crashed by 80% in just weeks. The Hunts couldn’t pay their debts, creditors went after them and they eventually went bankrupt. The lesson? You can corner supply, but not demand. If value rests only on hoarding and hype, the market is brittle. And once confidence breaks and the flow of buyers dries up, prices collapse under their own weight. And that’s what makes Trump Media’s Cronos plan look so fragile. CRO isn’t silver, but the parallels are clear. The Hunts tried to create value by locking up supply. Trump Media wants to do the same by hoarding CRO tokens. But just as silver’s worth depended on jewelers, industrial users and investors continuing to buy — CRO’s worth depends on people actually using the Cronos blockchain. Hoarding about 20% of it in a corporate vault doesn’t make it more useful. It makes it brittle. To be fair, Trump Media isn’t blind to these criticisms. Running a validator node is a legitimate business activity. It’s like not just hoarding HUL shares, but also running its factories and earning dividends. In theory, staking yields make CRO more than dead inventory. Trump Media has even locked up its investment for years to signal commitment. So if Cronos adoption soars, they could spin this as “skin in the game”. And investors might celebrate the illusion of value. It may even push the adoption of the new asset class we’ve been seeing lately—corporate crypto treasuries or “digital asset treasuries”. If MicroStrategy can hold Bitcoin, why not Trump Media with CRO? But the contradiction is hard to miss. Validators only make sense when tokens are in motion. That is when users are paying fees, staking coins, and keeping the blockchain alive. The more activity, the more validators earn. Treasuries work in the opposite way. Their bet is that if you lock away a large portion of supply, the token looks scarce, and scarcity can push up its price on paper. So one model feeds on circulation, the other feeds on scarcity. Put them together, and they cancel each other out. And by chaining itself so tightly to CRO, Trump Media isn’t hedging its risks but concentrating them in a coin that already trades with thin liquidity. Oh and remember, this CRO play is just one act in a larger Trump crypto carnival. The family is building an entire crypto empire : $2.5 billion raised to buy Bitcoin, a DeFi company called World Liberty Financial where they profited $500 million and hold 22.5 billion WLFI tokens, and even memecoins like $MELANIA and $TRUMP, which briefly neared $10 billion before crashing. And the perks weren’t dividends, but dinners with the President. Seen through this lens, the CRO isn’t the big story. It’s just another ride in a Trump-branded theme park of speculative attractions. They’re not betting on one coin. They’re planting toll booths at every layer of the crypto economy. From crypto coins and infrastructure to wrappers and the crypto hype. And as always, those closest to the project—the ones with the networks, the tokens, the inside track—stand to make the real money. Still, it risks looking like a pump-and-dump in disguise. So help us decide, Mr Trump. Can you really corner a cryptocurrency — an asset meant to be open and decentralised — and still keep its fundamentals intact? Or is this just audacity tipping into absurdity? To us, this sounds nuts. Not because it’s risky or politically flashy. But because it misunderstands the most basic truth about blockchains .

But before we begin, if you’re someone who loves to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance, then hit subscribe if you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story. The Story Warren Buffett is upset! Back in 2015, his company Berkshire Hathaway , joined hands with Brazilian private-equity giant 3G Capital, to pull off a blockbuster merger. The plan was to mash together Kraft Foods, the cheese champion of American households, with H.J. Heinz, the company you might know as the world’s ketchup king, cross-leverage the brands, and build a global food giant. On paper, it looked like a delicious idea. Berkshire and 3G already had big stakes in both companies. So they took Heinz private in 2013 for $28 billion . Two years later, they bought Kraft for $63 billion and merged the two companies together. And 3G had a reputation too. They were famous for their ruthless cost-cutting playbook, which they’d already tested at Heinz. The idea was to save $1.5 billion through synergies by 2017. Everything was lined up for sweet returns. But then it turns out that cheese and ketchup go well in a sandwich, not so much on Wall Street. Because over the past decade, Kraft Heinz’s stock has lost more than 60% of its value. Meanwhile, the S&P 500, the benchmark for US stocks, has more than tripled over the same period. To put it simply, the merger just didn’t deliver as expected. While 3G read the writing on the wall early and slowly sold its stake, finally exiting in 2023, Berkshire stayed put — even though Buffett admitted they overpaid, calling himself ‘wrong in a couple of ways on Kraft Heinz.’ And that regret seems to be catching up now. Kraft Heinz has finally had enough and wants to undo the decade-old merger, splitting back into two separate companies. But this U-turn won’t come cheap. It’ll cost about $300 million just to make the split happen. Naturally, Buffett isn’t pleased. Berkshire still owns 27.5% of the company, making it the largest shareholder. And in his view, such a huge decision only means wasteful spending that eats into shareholder value. Which makes you wonder — what exactly went wrong at Kraft Heinz? To understand that, we’ll need to go back and dig into why the two companies merged in the first place. The idea behind the merger was simple. Kraft and Heinz had different strengths that seemed to complement each other. Kraft dominated grocery staples in North America. Think cheese, packaged lunches, pantry essentials. And Heinz was the global leader in sauces and condiments. Put them under one roof, and the thinking was that the brands could work together and grow faster. But the reality was trickier. Once the merger happened, the problems began to show. Managing so many overlapping brands under one roof wasn’t easy. The company struggled to decide how to spend its money and resources between Kraft’s old-school groceries and Heinz’s faster-growing condiments. This tug-of-war meant that some brands didn’t get the attention they needed . At times, Kraft and Heinz products even ended up competing against each other for shelf space in the same stores. That hurt sales instead of helping them. Another big issue was cost-cutting. 3G Capital, which helped drive the merger, was known for slashing expenses aggressively. At Kraft Heinz, this meant cutting back on investments in advertising and innovation. For a while, this saved money. But over time, it left some of the company’s most famous brands underfunded and struggling to keep up. Meanwhile, the market was changing. Inflation meant shoppers were hunting for cheaper options, and local grocery store-brand labels were getting more popular. And since Kraft Heinz wasn’t investing enough in its own brands, many of them lost ground to these private-label products. Sure, the company tried to fight back with $1 packs of Mac & Cheese and salad dressing, but it wasn’t enough as consumer tastes were shifting too. People wanted healthier, less processed food. Lunchables — Kraft Heinz’s iconic snack trays for kids, even had to be dropped from school menus last year owing to falling demand. Then came another blow. Weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy started becoming popular. People using them were eating less, especially cutting down on snacks and sugary foods. That also chipped away at Kraft Heinz’s sales. Add all these issues up and you’ll see why sales started falling . For context, back in 2015, when the merger happened, Kraft Heinz had annual revenues of more than $28 billion. By 2024, that number had dropped to about $26 billion . The stock price also took a beating. What was once billed as the creation of one of the world’s largest food companies ended up looking like a poor investment. And that’s exactly why Kraft Heinz now wants to reverse course. The plan is to split back into two companies — one focused on sauces, spreads and seasonings, and the other on groceries and packaged staples. The hope is that, by separating, each business can focus on its own strengths and challenges. For example, the sauces business could push more into innovation and premium products, while the grocery business could focus on keeping costs low and staying competitive. Each company would have its own management team, its own strategy, and its own budget. This simpler setup could also make it easier to respond to changing consumer preferences — whether it’s reducing sugar in juices, removing artificial colours or launching preservative-free hot dogs. Of course, this isn’t going to magically solve everything overnight. But the company believes that this move will “unlock shareholder value”. In other words, investors will be able to judge each company separately, without the baggage of the other weighing it down. Still, there’s some irony here. Ten years ago, Kraft and Heinz were independent companies and thought they’d do better together. Now, they believe they’ll do better apart. So yeah, whether this new bet pays off is something only time will tell. Until then… Don’t forget to share this story on WhatsApp , LinkedIn and X . Myth Alert: I'm Too Young to Buy Life Insurance!

https://finshots.in/archive/what-gst-2-0-should-promise,2025-07-14,Policy,What GST 2.0 should promise,"14 July 2025 • Policy What GST 2.0 should promise In today’s Finshots, we tell you what’s up with all the talks around changes in GST. But before we begin, if you’re someone who loves to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance, then hit subscribe if you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story. The Story Eight years ago, the government pulled off something many believed was impossible. It stitched together a wildly fragmented indirect tax system across 29 states, 7 union territories, and countless local quirks into one common framework: the Goods and Services Tax or GST. No more VAT here, service tax there, octroi at the borders, or a jumble of entry taxes. Just one system. One framework. One nation, one tax. And for the most part, it delivered. Gross GST collection has doubled in the last five years from ₹11 lakh crore in FY21 to ₹22 lakh crore in FY25. Active GST taxpayers now number over 1.5 crore. Even small firms to corporations say it’s helped simplify tax administration and improve ease of doing business. Interstate trade flows more smoothly. And compliance has gone digital. So, India’s grand consumption-based tax reform seemed to be on the right track. But there still remain a few troubling signs. GST collection growth hasn’t kept up with GDP growth. That’s a worrying sign for a system that was supposed to scale with the economy. And the concerns run deeper than just the numbers. Businesses, policy experts and even state governments increasingly feel that GST, in its current form, is beginning to feel more like a drag than a driver. Which is why all eyes are now on the 56th GST Council meeting scheduled for this month, where a long overdue overhaul may finally be on the cards. So what’s broken, you ask? Well, for starters, GST was never going to be easy. It was a compromise between the Centre and the states, held together by a common promise: every state would give up its individual tax powers in exchange for a unified, fairer and more efficient system. The Centre even offered compensation for states that lost out: a guaranteed revenue growth every year for five years. And to fund this, it levied a compensation cess on so-called sin goods like tobacco, aerated drinks and luxury cars. But COVID broke that arrangement. Revenues tanked, compensation fell short and the Centre borrowed to make up the gap. And while the compensation agreement officially ended in 2022, the cess didn’t as the government confirmed to keep it till March 2026. It’s still being collected, but now the funds go to the Centre to repay its loans, not to the states. This hasn’t gone down well. The trust that held GST together is now showing signs of strain. And without consensus from the GST Council, where states get to vote, reforms simply stall. And many are stalling already. After the expiry of compensation cess, the Centre is proposing to replace it with two new levies (a Health Cess on tobacco and other harmful substances and a Clean Energy Cess on coal and automobiles). But the major concern here is how will the proceeds be distributed from these cesses. Will they go to states or the Centre? And the answer to that requires co-operative federalism. Then you can also look at rate rationalisation. Today, GST has four main slabs: 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%, plus a range of exemptions and cesses. It’s a confusing structure, and worse, a regressive one. Many essentials like toothpaste, soap and umbrellas are taxed at 12% or 18%, while some luxury items fall in the same bracket. So the Centre is now pushing a big idea to scrap the 12% slab entirely. Shift key goods down to 5% and nudge a few others up to 18%. Yes, this is said to cost the exchequer ₹40,000 to ₹50,000 crore in the short run. But the hope is that lower prices will boost consumption, broaden the tax base and make up the losses over time. But the problem is that not all states agree. Punjab, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, and West Bengal have already raised objections. Still, the reform seems urgent because it’s not just coming from policymakers. The industry wants it too. Rajiv Memani, President of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), puts it plainly in a recent MoneyControl interview … “I think it’s time to do the 2.0 version of reform. More simplification particularly in the course of audits, more simplification in compliance.” That’s not an exaggeration. You see, one of GST ’s biggest promises was that businesses could claim credit on taxes paid on raw materials. But in practice, this chain breaks down constantly. If your vendor files late, you lose credit. If there’s an invoice mismatch, your refund gets stuck. Frequent rule changes only add to the confusion. And capital-heavy sectors end up with crores in limbo. We wrote about the mess this system created and how GST officials unearthed a fake credit invoice racket worth ₹11,500 crores back in 2021 . Then there’s the audit mess. GST treats each state registration as a separate entity. So a company operating in five states faces multiple audits, and no coordination. All of which can make the entire process cumbersome. As Memani puts it… “If you're operating in five states, it doesn't mean you need to have five audits. You can have one audit and all the states can rely on that audit.“ And let’s not forget the sectors still outside GST like fuel and alcohol . These are massive revenue contributors, but states rely on them for independent revenue and they’re reluctant to let go. But this exclusion breaks the input tax credit chain and distorts pricing. A logistics firm pays GST on truck maintenance, but not on fuel. That’s not how a unified system is supposed to work. The Centre could solve this by offering a higher share in central taxes. But that offer hasn’t come and that has only made the cooperation more strangled. So sure, GST lived up to many things. But now, the system feels busy in implementation or patching issues instead of bringing in reforms that are the need of the hour. And that’s why GST 2.0 is now a necessity. The government knows this too. A few months ago, the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament called for a massive overhaul . And the demand is growing louder. There’s already a wish list doing the rounds: move to a three-rate structure (say 5%, 15% and 28%) with cesses only on sin goods. Bring insurance and fuel under GST, even if gradually. Remove the compensation cess now that its job is done. And above all, rebuild the Centre–State partnership that made GST possible in the first place. None of this will be easy. The politics is tricky, the costs are real and consensus will take work. But the alternative – patchwork reforms, constant tinkering and growing fatigue, is far worse. That’s why this upcoming GST Council meeting matters. It isn’t just another policy review but a moment where India decides whether GST is just a tax, or still a transformative idea. After all, GST wasn’t just a fiscal fix. It was meant to be a symbol of unity and reform. And a tax that was meant to unite India shouldn’t feel like a burden eight years in, yeah?

https://finshots.in/archive/gold-is-the-new-treasury,2025-09-03,Macro,Gold is the new treasury?,"3 September 2025 • Macro Gold is the new treasury? In today’s Finshots we tell you why central banks now hold more gold than US Treasuries and what that tells us about money and investing. But before we begin, if you love keeping up with the buzz in business and finance, make sure to subscribe and join the Finshots club, loved by over 5 lakh readers. Already a subscriber or reading this on the app? You’re all set. Go ahead and enjoy the story! The Story Last week, central banks — the people who decide what money is — quietly crossed a line. For the first time in almost 30 years , the value of gold in their vaults overtook the value of US Treasuries they hold. Source It’s a bit like discovering your grandmother’s jewellery box is worth more than the fixed deposit she’s been boasting about for decades. Well, that’s essentially what just happened, except on a macro scale and that changes a few things. For decades one of the safest forms of money you could own has been US government bonds. Or call them Treasuries. They’re an important part of global finance for a few reasons. The US government is considered the ultimate borrower. Unlike a company or a household, it cannot technically go broke, because it can always raise taxes or print dollars to repay. Then, the Treasury market is also the deepest and most liquid in the world, where roughly $29 trillion is held by investors worldwide. You could buy and sell them in minutes, which is a priceless feature if you’re a central bank juggling reserves. And Treasuries pay you interest, unlike cash sitting idle. Gold, on the other hand, is the sentimental favourite. It sparkles in vaults and certainly has history. But it doesn’t yield, it doesn't compound, and it costs money to store. So central bankers weren’t as keen on adding it to their balance sheets as they have been over the last few years. The change in central bank holding value you saw above is because, well, first, gold’s price went berserk. Since 2024, it rose from $2,000 to touch $3,400 an ounce today. Which meant that even if central banks hadn’t bought a single extra bar, the ones they already had were suddenly looking very plump indeed. But they went on buying over 1,000 tonnes of more gold in 2024 alone, and 410 tonnes more in the first six months of 2025. So that’s some serious commitment, you could say. Meanwhile, Treasuries have lost their edge. The reason comes down to the dollar itself. While we tend to talk about the rupee “losing ground,” the US dollar has been losing its purchasing power too. Source Since January 2020, it has lost around 30% of its value. So a chocolate bar that cost $1 in 2020 now costs $1.30. And that $0.3, or 30% difference is inflation. Now here’s where Treasuries get tricky. They give around 4% returns today. But if inflation is 3% a year, your real return is just 1%. If inflation sneaks higher, or above 4%, you could actually be losing money. And historically, that’s exactly what has happened. If you track this back to 1971 (when the US ended the gold standard and dollar became pure paper money), the dollar has lost purchasing power at an average pace of about 4% a year. As this calculator shows, a dollar in 1971 has the same buying power as nearly $8 today. That works out to about 4% inflation a year on average. Which means that while the Fed keeps talking about a 2% inflation target, the long-term reality has been closer to double that. Economists call this “debasement.” It’s the slow dilution of value when money supply grows faster than the economy. This matters for central banks today because unless yields rise above that 4% debasement rate, they’re effectively paying the US government for holding US Treasuries. And the US, bless its heart, has a debt pile so large now — more than $37 trillion — that you start to wonder whether they’re handing out these bond guarantees on the back of napkins. And you can also blame this shift to how reserves were controlled. In 2022, when the West froze Russia’s billions worth of reserves overnight, central bankers worldwide felt a chill. It was clear that Treasuries, for all their stability, are only as safe as the politics that govern them. Gold, on the other hand, is gloriously inert. If a central bank holds the bars in its own vault, it doesn’t just own a claim, it owns the asset outright. Now, if this all sounds faintly familiar, that’s because we’ve seen a version of it before. In the 1970s, when the US cut its ties to gold, inflation soared into double digits. Treasuries delivered negative real returns as bondholders lost money in real terms year after year. Gold, once pegged at $35 an ounce, soared to nearly $400 by 1979 and briefly touched $850 in 1980. Central banks adjusted then, too, reaching for gold instead of bonds. Sure, today isn’t a perfect repeat of that as the dollar still dominates nearly 60% of global reserves, markets are far more sophisticated, and inflation isn’t in the same league. But the rhyme is clear that when debt is heavy and trust wobbles, gold returns to fashion. This doesn’t mean the dollar or Treasuries are dead. If you want to buy oil, settle international trades, or issue sovereign bonds, you still need them. What’s changed is that central banks aren’t putting all their eggs in the Treasury basket anymore. Treasuries still offer liquidity, while gold offers sovereignty. And a smart reserve portfolio needs both. India, naturally, hasn’t missed the memo. The RBI has brought back over 100 tonnes from overseas reserve vaults in FY25. Because in a world tilting toward sanctions and tariffs, you don’t want your insurance policy sitting in someone else’s cupboard. And that’s why gold now makes up about 12% of India’s foreign reserves. So what does all this mean for the rest of us? For one, gold prices aren’t likely to collapse anytime soon. When central banks buy and never sell, they quietly take supply off the market. That alone acts like a safety net under the price. For the US, the consequence is subtler but real. It can still issue debt, and in obscene amounts. But it does mean it may have to pay a smidge more than before. And that matters because even a small uptick in yields, when multiplied across trillions of debt, balloons into billions in extra costs. The bigger paradox is this. Central banks keep the financial system alive by printing money. Yet they seem to sleep better knowing they’ve parked a chunk of that very money in gold. So the lesson isn’t hard to miss. If the people who mint money are hedging against money itself, perhaps the rest of us should take note too. Interesting, isn’t it? The story of finance isn’t always about invention. More often, it’s about rediscovering what we’ve always known. Until then… Don’t forget to share this story on WhatsApp , LinkedIn and X . Myth Alert: I'm Too Young to Buy Life Insurance!

https://finshots.in/archive/why-cancer-care-is-becoming-private-hospitals-biggest-driver,2025-09-02,Business,Why cancer care is becoming private hospitals’ biggest driver,"2 September 2025 • Business Why cancer care is becoming private hospitals’ biggest driver In today’s Finshots, we explain why oncology is turning into a major revenue driver for private hospitals while public cancer care initiatives are failing to keep up. But before we begin, if you love keeping up with the buzz in business and finance, make sure to subscribe and join the Finshots club, loved by over 5 lakh readers. Already a subscriber or reading this on the app? You’re all set. Go ahead and enjoy the story! The Story India’s population is growing but so are chronic illnesses. And cancer sits among the top illnesses leading the list. The Indian Council of Medical Research says India saw 8.7 lakh cancer deaths and 15.6 lakh new cases in 2024. And today, the lifetime risk of developing cancer for an average Indian stands at 11%. So yes, India is staring at a growing cancer crisis. Now, cancer treatment doesn’t come cheap. Depending on the city, the cancer type and stage, treatment can set you back anywhere between ₹1 lakh to ₹27 lakh . That’s because it requires specialised doctors called oncologists, advanced diagnostics, surgeries, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The equipment alone is eye-wateringly expensive. A linear accelerator (LINAC), which is used for radiation therapy, can cost up to ₹5.2 crore , while a PET-CT scanner ranges from ₹1.8-3.3 crores . So there’s a pressing need for access to these treatments. And the government hasn’t ignored the crisis. Over the past few years, it has rolled out schemes like the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases ( NP-NCD ), sanctioned up to ₹120 crore for State Cancer Institutes (SCIs) and ₹45 crore for Tertiary Cancer Care Centres, and even promised 200 district cancer day centres by 2026. But execution is where the cracks show (and we’ll tell you why in a bit). And that’s the gap private hospital chains have spotted as their opportunity. Because today, oncology isn’t just a high demand specialty for hospitals, it’s a key revenue driver. Take Max Healthcare, India’s largest listed hospital chain. Over a quarter of their ₹2,042 crore revenue last quarter (Q1FY26) was from oncology alone – more than cardiac sciences (10.4%) and orthopedics (11.8%). Fortis Healthcare saw a 28% year on year jump in oncology revenue in the same period, which now contributes over 16% of their total income. And not to forget HCG, which operates the highest number of cancer centres in India, has seen its revenues grow at 19% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) from FY20 to FY24. Which makes us ask, why are private hospitals at such an advantage? Well, it comes down to three main factors, starting with government initiatives. The NP-NCD initiative we spoke of above shows there have been public investments made for cancer care. However, the benefits rarely flow as intended since the reach for care and talent shortage strains the public health system significantly. Take Kidwai , one of the largest state-run cancer hospitals. It has seen MRI machines break down for weeks. Now, skipping this scan isn’t an option for many patients, which keeps them waiting without an alternative choice. Other SCIs face bed shortages, like Jaipur’s State Cancer Institute, that’s equipped with just 170 beds , far short of demand. Then there’s the talent crunch. AIIMS, the leading government healthcare institute across India, has been struggling with talent. It’s unable to keep specialists and also fill positions. Around 429 doctors have resigned from 20 AIIMS institutes between 2022-2024, with 1 in 3 faculty posts lying vacant. These exits mean the leading physicians are leaning towards working in the private sector, giving big hospital chains an upper hand. Punjab is a case in point, where cancer cases rose from 39,521 in 2021 to 42,288 in 2024, but only 19 of 43 sanctioned posts at Government Medical College, Amritsar, are filled. And finally, access and funding are lopsided. Public centres provide treatment at a fraction of private costs. But that affordability means that government expansion gets slowed down and access to treatment can be stretched. In the North East, over 75% of the population is rural but 95% of cancer care facilities are in urban areas. This forces patients to seek late-stage treatment in overcrowded centres, where survival rates are poor. Private hospitals, on the other hand, can mobilize capital quickly, bring in the top talent and expand aggressively. Apollo runs 10 dedicated cancer centres across India staffed with 125+ radiation and surgical specialists. Max Healthcare is spending ₹6,000 crore to double its capacity to 9,500 beds by 2028 and expand from 22 to 30 hospitals. Fortis has invested in precision oncology, with its Gurugram centre boasting one of the only two MR-LINAC machines (a fusion of MRI and linear accelerator) in India. Owning similar advanced technology allows hospitals to ask premium pricing from its patients, given how rare the treatment is. Plus, private players’ access to talent and capital gives them one big advantage above all else: Comprehensive care. You see, cancer treatment isn’t like cardiology or orthopedics. It’s not one surgery or one procedure but a complex web of diagnostics, surgery, chemo, immunotherapy, radiation, and constant monitoring. Private hospitals package all of this under one roof. That’s a big differentiator because public systems and smaller hospitals often force patients to shuttle between centres. So put all of it together, and you know how that allows private players to command a bigger market, and set their own prices. And maybe that’s what matters: Putting oncology at the center of demand, cost and capacity. For patients, it’s a life changing point. And maybe that’s something that the government initiatives can include in their expansion plan. If public programmes move on par with private institutes, or even pair up with private players in the form of private-public-partnership model, India could move closer to a future where cancer care isn’t a privilege, and every patient regardless of city or income receives comprehensive cancer care.

https://finshots.in/archive/how-mahindra-became-indias-2nd-biggest-carmaker,2025-09-01,Business,How Mahindra became India’s 2nd biggest carmaker,"1 September 2025 • Business How Mahindra became India’s 2nd biggest carmaker In today’s Finshots, we talk about how Mahindra became India’s biggest SUV company and also the 2nd biggest car maker. But before we begin, if you love keeping up with the buzz in business and finance, make sure to subscribe and join the Finshots club, loved by over 5 lakh readers. Already a subscriber or reading this on the app? You’re all set. Go ahead and enjoy the story! The Story Just 25 years ago, Indian roads looked very different, and by Indian roads, we mean the cars that drove on them. It was either a hatchback or sedan, and rarely, an SUV (Sports Utility Vehicle). And even those hatchbacks were mostly made by either Maruti Suzuki or Hyundai India. These companies became household names in the car market by capitalizing on one standard belief: India was the land for small cars. And because of that, homegrown car makers like Mahindra and Tata Motors, who were largely into SUVs, trucks and tractors, struggled to rise through the ranks. But things have flipped. In February this year, Mahindra took the 2nd spot , outdoing Hyundai in terms of overall domestic vehicle sales. And by Q1FY26 , the trend was cemented — Mahindra sold 1.52 lakh SUVs out of 2.47 lakh total vehicles (a 27% revenue market share). Meanwhile, Hyundai’s total sales slipped to 1.8 lakh units, down from 1.92 lakh a year earlier. And its SUV sales slipped from 1.01 lakh to 90,531 units. So how did Mahindra capture the SUV market better than anyone else? Well, it comes down to three things: The turning point, the numbers and the strategy. We’ll start with the turning point for cars in India. Owning an SUV is seen as a status symbol. It has a stronger presence on the roads, safer to drive and the ideal choice for India’s aspirational goals. Plus, what we’re seeing isn’t just the rise of the SUV market, but also a decline in the hatchback and sedan segment. And the entry point to this segment is something unique to India: the compact SUV. It has blurred the lines between hatchbacks and SUVs. Which makes Mahindra’s SUV-first approach on par with where the market was moving. Plus, there’s a tax twist . In India, SUVs longer than 4 metres attract a higher GST plus cess. But because compact SUVs fall just shy of 4 metres (and engines smaller than 1200cc) , they’re comfortably taxed lower. That’s why cars like Mahindra’s XUV3XO that are less than 4 metres are such a hit among customers. It’s one of the best selling cars in their fleet, which saw sales rise from 54,726 units (FY24) to 100,905 units (FY25) in a year. So yes, with Mahindra already being an SUV-first company, the shift played right into its hands. It’s the space that automakers are competing for aggressively. And Mahindra plans to build on its success with the NU_IQ platform, which will allow it to capture more of the compact SUV segment by using the platform for both – its electric as well as internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Oh, and there’s also a policy advantage that worked in Mahindra’s favour. India has tightened the fuel economy standards for cars through CAFE or Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency norms . The idea was simple: an automaker can sell big, heavy fuel consuming SUVs if it wants, but it has to balance them with smaller, more fuel-efficient cars so that its average across all cars sold in a year doesn’t cross the government’s set limit for CO₂ emissions. Now, because of this, smaller car makers like Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai India were caught in a twist. But for Mahindra, an SUV heavy portfolio meant less effort to balance CAFE scores and focus on EVs. Now, the numbers that tell the bigger story. Of the total 4.3 million cars dispatched in India in FY25, 2.79 million cars were SUVs and MPVs (Multi-Purpose Vehicles). That’s 65% of the market and a huge shift in preference from a decade ago, when SUVs made up 21% of all passenger car sales. So car makers with non-SUV portfolios saw themselves on the wrong side of the shift. Sure, they released their own compact SUVs, but for customers, they still felt like a hatchback trying to be an SUV. Mahindra, on the other hand, was able to capitalize on this shift in demand by offering more options, like the Scorpio-N, Thar (rugged SUVs for adventure seekers), XUV3XO (an entry level SUV), and XUV700 (for a larger family). That’s an option for every type of customer across the SUV ladder, all from one manufacturer. And how did it pull all this off while its competition played catch up? The strategy sealed the deal. Mahindra didn’t just build a range of SUVs but also backed that up with execution. Not long back, they had issues on the assembly line because of which some models had waiting periods of nearly 2 years after booking. Now that’s a lot of time to wait for a car, and it gives customers enough time to go window shopping for the next best option. So Mahindra reduced it by upping their production capacity. Some cars like the XUV700 had wait times of 1-2 years, now reduced to 1-5 months or less based on the variant. It achieved this by adopting a manufacturing method called ‘ Single Piece Flow ’ – a lean manufacturing method that boosts efficiency by increasing productivity, reducing waste and shortening production lead time. And it shows in the results. In the recent quarter, the company’s net profit soared by 24% to ₹4,083 crores , driven up by margins from SUVs and tractors. And now, Mahindra is pushing into EVs. Its BE.6 and XEV 9e have already sold more than 12,000 units within months of launch, showing strong demand. So yeah, Mahindra’s rise to India’s 2nd-largest carmaker isn’t just luck. It’s the result of spotting a shift, sticking to its strengths, and doubling down on what customers actually wanted. And maybe this isn’t just Mahindra’s win, but a telling milestone of how India’s car preferences have shifted gears over the years.

https://finshots.in/archive/sebi-has-an-algo-trading-plan-for-retail-investors,2024-12-19,Capital Markets,SEBI has an algo trading plan for retail investors,"19 December 2024 • Capital Markets SEBI has an algo trading plan for retail investors In today’s Finshots, we break down SEBI’s idea of letting retail investors use algo trading in a more regulated setup. But before we begin, if you’re someone who loves to keep tabs on what’s happening in the world of business and finance, then hit subscribe if you haven’t already. If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story. The Story India has nearly 10 crore retail investors . That’s one in every five households across the country! Many of these investors are everyday folks like us, juggling full-time jobs. So while the stock market might lure us with the prospect of making some cool profits, keeping track of price tickers all day is tough and sometimes even impractical. That could often mean higher chances of losses or stepping away from markets altogether. Enter algorithmic trading, or algo trading , which is a game-changer for situations like these. Think of it like having a computer trade for you. You set rules for price, timing and volume, and it executes trades automatically. For instance, if you’re interested in textile stocks, you could program an algorithm to buy stocks in this sector when prices rise 5% over a week, assuming that demand is strong, or sell when they drop by 5%. The best part? You don’t have to stay glued to the screen. It’s all automated. But here’s the thing. Despite all the buzz around algo trading, Indian retail investors have largely been left out of it. That’s because institutional investors have enjoyed greater freedom since algo trading launched in 2008 . But retail investors only got a set of these regulations in 2021. These rules placed the responsibility for algo trading on brokers, meaning retail investors had to rely on pre-built algorithms provided by brokers, which were executed exclusively on their servers. And this setup wasn’t ideal. Just think about it. A glitch in the broker’s system, a loophole in their strategy or even manipulation from their end could lead to massive losses for retail investors. Unregulated algo providers also offered risky services, leaving investors with no way to address grievances. SEBI seemed to catch on to these problems and naturally it cracked down. But it didn’t stop there. It also realised that simply clamping down on algo trading wasn’t the solution. It needed to go a step further, regulate the space and take charge of overseeing it. And there’s enough reason that nudged it to think on these lines. A recent study revealed that individual traders lost over ₹61,000 crores in the equity F&O segment in FY24, while large entities using trading algorithms, like proprietary traders and foreign investors, walked away with gross profits of ₹33,000 crores and ₹28,000 crores, respectively. Clearly, retail investors were fighting a losing battle against sophisticated algorithms. And that’s exactly why SEBI is now working to make algo trading more accessible to retail investors, in a safer and well-regulated environment. And SEBI’s suggestions are simple. It proposes tagging orders exceeding certain speed or volume as algo orders. Then, it requires brokers to get stock exchange approvals for any algorithm they offer. Third-party algo providers will act as agents of brokers and must also meet eligibility criteria and register with stock exchanges. Then, SEBI splits these algorithms into two types. First up, there are White Box Algos that are fully transparent. Here, investors can see and understand the logic, like say, an algo that buys shares when a stock hits ₹100. And second, we have Black Box Algos, where the investors don’t really know how the algorithms work internally. Such algos are opaque and therefore providers must register as “Research Analysts” and submit detailed reports for these to stock exchanges. Exchanges will also supervise algo trading and ensure everything runs smoothly. So stock exchanges will now have to have a rule book to test algorithms. Basically, rules so that stock brokers can verify how these algos would have performed using past data. This helps traders figure out which parts of their system work and which don’t. It also allows exchanges to ensure that brokers submitting algos for approval are ironing out any flaws beforehand. Besides, if an algo goes rogue, it prescribes a kill switch mechanism or a kind of emergency brake tool. If an algorithm malfunctions, the kill switch can instantly halt trading to minimise damage. Think of it as the last line of defence, kicking in automatically based on pre-set conditions. So yeah, with these measures, SEBI wants to make algo trading safer, hold brokers accountable and protect retail investors like us from unnecessary risks. And these regulations are actually an upgrade from their 2021 version. Back then, SEBI suggested that all orders coming through an API i.e. Application Programming Interface, or a bridge that allows different software to communicate, should be treated as algo orders. Because frankly, neither exchanges nor brokers could differentiate between algo trades and non-algo trades if they came through an API link. But here’s the thing. APIs are everywhere! Even the trading apps you use to log in or place simple limit orders (orders at a specific stock price) rely on APIs. So treating every API order as an algo trade would have been quite overboard and could have slowed down tech advancements designed to make trading easier for investors. SEBI seems to have realised this and tweaked its stance. Its new approach focuses on speed and volume thresholds instead. So now, only orders exceeding a certain speed or volume threshold will be treated as algo trades. And this thoughtful regulation could transform India’s markets for the better. For context, today, around 50% of traders in India use algorithms, compared to 60–70% in markets like the US and Europe. And making algo trading more accessible could bring more accurate and cost-effective trades. Moreover, algorithms can analyse and execute trades at lightning speed and eliminate emotional biases like fear or greed that we humans have, reducing the chances of poor decisions. So yeah, this truly feels like a step forward. It’s not all smooth sailing, though. One potential hurdle lies in the requirement for stock exchanges to approve every trading algorithm. According to the Indian Association of Investment Professionals , a similar rule in SEBI’s 2021 regulations could make things tricky. Because trading strategies need to adapt quickly to changing market conditions. And by the time an exchange approves a strategy, it might already be outdated and the trading opportunity could slip away. So this time, SEBI has suggested fast-track registration for certain algos, aiming for quicker approvals. But the turnaround time is still up to the exchanges, so we’ll have to see how well it works in practice. And even with these regulations, algo trading isn’t immune to Black Swan events — those rare, unpredictable shocks. Take the example of textile stocks we mentioned earlier. If an algo is programmed to buy when prices rise 5% in a week, an unexpected event, like the Bangladesh crisis pushing textile stocks up by 20% overnight, could throw it off. The algorithm might be in a situation where it’s unable to handle such wild swings and end up buying or selling at the wrong time, causing poorly timed trades and huge losses. That’s where stock exchanges could step in. If they not only back-test algorithms with past data but also stress-test them for extreme scenarios, much like they do with equity derivatives like F&O, it could reduce risks and improve preparedness. For now, though, these rules are just part of a consultation paper SEBI floated last week. And we’ll only have to wait and see how things shape up after the feedback rolls in.

https://finshots.in/archive/sponge-cities-for-india-car-speed-subscriptions-and-more,2025-08-31,Sunny Side Up,"Sponge cities for India, car speed subscriptions and more…","31 August 2025 • Sunny Side Up Sponge cities for India, car speed subscriptions and more… Hey folks! It may be that if you’re planning on buying a car, and if that’s Volkswagen, you might not own all its horsepower. Huh? Yep. Instead, you’d have to pay a monthly fee to unlock the extra speed. Now, before you worry, this isn’t in India yet — it’s just the UK for now. And the pitch is simple. Instead of paying upfront for a higher-powered engine model, you could buy a cheaper base version, and then subscribe later to unlock more engine performance. The "" optional power upgrade "", they say, will cost £16.50 per month or £165 annually, or £649 for a lifetime subscription. Of course, this isn’t the first time automakers have tried this. BMW once offered ‘ heated seats ’ for $18/month and Mercedes sold faster acceleration for $1,200/year. But… both ideas faced backlash. And BMW ended up offering those features without costs. So why does VW think it’ll work? Well, nothing much. It’s partly down to how EVs today are mostly software-defined. Most trims use the same motor and battery but the difference is in the code. A few lines of software decide how much power you can use or how quickly the throttle responds. So the vehicle already has the capability; the software just decides how much you can access. And it’s also how players differentiate their offerings from competitors. That’s why VW is selling it as ‘flexibility.’ City drives? Stick to the cheaper plan. A long trip? Pay for a boost that month. For VW, subscriptions mean a steady stream of revenue. Tesla already makes billions selling software upgrades like Autopilot or extra battery range, and analysts think such add-ons could become a billion-dollar market in the years ahead. Here’s the thing though. Aren’t we all fed up with… subscriptions?! An S&P Global survey found most buyers of connected car services were interested just for the free trial or didn’t want it altogether as they were put off by extra costs. Because when ownership comes with a monthly fee, is it really ownership at all? Or just renting what’s already yours from the service provider? Imagine your car refusing to speed up unless you keep paying. So yeah, fingers crossed the future of driving doesn’t park speed behind a paywall. Here’s a soundtrack to put you in the mood 🎵 Piece By Piece by Pharell Williams You can thank our reader Ram Prasad for this unique rec! Ready to roll now? What caught our eye this week 👀 Why can’t India build sponge cities? Copenhagen is on its way to becoming the world’s first full-fledged sponge city . What’s that, you ask? Think of a city designed like a giant sponge — soaking up rainwater instead of letting it flood the streets. Parks, lakes, green rooftops, rain gardens… all working together to catch and redirect rainwater back into the cycle. Smart, right? But Copenhagen didn’t just magically wake up with this idea one day. Back in 2011, it was hit by what they called a “ once-in-a-1,000-year ” rain. The city drowned. Since then, they’ve had multiple “once-in-a-100-year” cloudbursts too. Streets filled up with water, property was destroyed, and there were even dead rats floating around while sanitation workers fell sick. Add to that the rising sea levels — since the city sits on two islands — and they realised this problem wasn’t going away. So they borrowed an idea from China: sponge cities. It wouldn’t just help them manage floods but would also cool the city and make it greener. And other global cities, like Germany’s Berlin, are already taking notes. Which brings us to India. Because let’s be honest, every time it rains heavily, cities like Mumbai or Bengaluru come to a standstill. Offices shut, traffic goes underwater, and businesses lose crores. So if sponge cities make so much sense, why can’t we have them here? Well, here’s the catch. Our cities just aren’t planned properly. In Bengaluru , for instance, drains don’t even have proper maps. Builders often get approval to construct right on top of water bodies or natural drains. So when it rains, there’s nowhere for the water to go except the streets. This is a city that used to be called “well-planned”. But with rapid urbanisation and an increase in population, that framework has collapsed. Now sure, population shouldn’t be an excuse, you might say. China has a huge population too. But you also have to understand that the difference is, it has three times the land to spread its people across. So our real problem is corruption, poor planning, and the never-ending cycle of digging and re-digging the same roads without fixing the bigger issue. But there are solutions. One of them could be to rethink how we build drains, because the old-school drainage systems just can’t keep up anymore. Take Japan, for instance. Back in 2006, they built what’s called the “Underground Temple”, or officially, the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel. Fifty metres below Kasukabe City lies a giant network of five silos, each connected by 6.4 km of tunnels. When typhoons or heavy rains hit, the system gulps down the excess water and releases it safely into a nearby river. It’s so massive and awe-inspiring that it even doubles as a tourist attraction, with ticket sales helping fund its upkeep. Now, that’s smart city planning. And maybe that’s the kind of thinking Indian cities such as Hyderabad and Chennai — which have at least started experimenting with sponge zones — need to borrow. But places like Bengaluru, which still haven’t put this on the agenda, might need to make up their minds quickly, before the next flood makes the choice for them. Infographic 📊 Readers Recommend 🗒️ This week, our reader Kshitij Bhatia recommends reading The Gift of Rain by Tan Twan Eng. Kshitij writes, “I have a unique habit, whenever I go to a place to visit I pick up their local bestseller and read it to get more cultural insight of the place. Last Year I visited Malaysia and picked up The Gift of Rain, a very critically acclaimed book which has received many awards. The book is great because it is a historical fiction based in Penang, Malaysia and is based on a grey character that has his fair share of moral dilemmas during the Japanese Occupation of Malaysia during World War II. I strongly recommend this because it has many cultural nuances that open up world view and also makes the readers question how they perceive themselves based on the decisions they take in their lives.” Thanks for the rec, Kshitij!
